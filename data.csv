1,https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Canoo, the EV startup that scored a deal with the world's largest retailer, is a mess under the hood | Fortune","Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue. Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year. On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans. “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.” “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career. Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported. As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers. Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.

(GOEV),"JUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Canoo Inc. (Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech mobility company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2023.  ""We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase, while we still have things left to prove.

""The bets we have made around the redesign and functionality of our platform are beginning to play out successfully at multiple levels. We continue to move toward our goal of achieving 20,000 annual unit capacity. I think that's a tribute to the scrappiness of our team driving value to our customers and partners."" Third Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Third Quarter Financial Highlights: Second Half 2023 Business Outlook - Updated Based upon our current projections, we have updated our previously provided second half 2023 guidance as follows: See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC.

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

(HCAC). Canoo stock has pulled back significantly from its highs of $25 after the closing of the SPAC deal and now trades at ~$11 as of the closing from 5th March. Data by YCharts While the company has not made any revenue yet, we believe that the experienced management team and potential best-in class EV drive-train technology (skateboard) are key differentiating factors for the company. Canoo has established a strategic partnership with car manufacturer Hyundai for its proprietary skateboard technology. However, there is no further transparency from management on the details around the partnership. Besides engineering services, Canoo plans to manufacture different B2C EV types (lifestyle and sports) that will be brought to market via a subscription-only offering. Customers can access Canoo‘s cars by paying a monthly subscription that includes all maintenance fees, while offering a maximum flexibility with a minimum subscription duration of only 1 month. Canoo also recently announced details around its multi-purpose delivery vehicle, which will be part of its B2B offerings, by which the company aims to enter electrification of the large last-mile delivery vehicle space. In our view, success for Canoo depends on closure of potential partnerships for both its engineering segment and the recently announced B2B delivery-vehicle, as well as the level of customer adoption for its subscription model once the first B2C cars hit the market. This article provides a perspective on Canoo's technology and financial forecast up to 2025, and will discuss some of the risks and opportunities. Canoo's currently planned EVs include a lifestyle vehicle, a multi-purpose delivery vehicle and a sports vehicle, all set to be launched between Q2 2022 and 2025.  Source: Company presentation All vehicles will be built on the basis of Canoo's proprietary skateboard technology which essentially is a flat, drivable rolling chassis that contains the electrical architecture. The vehicle body just needs to be assembled on top of the skateboard. Management calls this a ""top hat design"" approach, which is expected to simplify the manufacturing process and may reduce cost and time to market. For the lifestyle vehicle, Canoo claims a 250-mile range per charge - in our view not very impressive. However, the fast recharge time (up to 80% in less than 30 minutes) may make up for that, and we believe that when battery technology improves further, Canoo should be able to upgrade its battery capacity. Further to note is the large 7-passenger seat capacity of the lifestyle vehicle, and the customizability of the top-hat.  Source: Company website Just recently, Canoo announced further details on its Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle. The fact that Canoo is also entering this segment is especially interesting in light of the large last-mile delivery market which Canoo's management says to be a $51bn market by 2022.  Source: Company website Many of the large companies in the space, including Amazon and UPS are commiting large investments into the electrification of their delivery fleets. This can be a big opportunity for Canoo as well. Availability of the delivery EV will begin in 2022 and large-scale production will commence in 2023. Canoo's delivery vehicle will also be built on the basis of the skateboard technology, which allows for maximum interior cargo space on a relatively small vehicle size which drives volume and energy efficiency.  Source: Company website The Canoo delivery vehicle will be available in different sizes of 200 and 450 FT³ Cargo Volume and different height and payload specifications allowing for multiple use-cases, starting at a ~$33,000 price. Canoo plans to offer customers best-in-class total cost of ownership, cargo volume, and functionally-designed features. Canoo's model is said to have some advantages with respect to total cargo volume (30% more parcel volume vs. current options) and total cost of ownership compared to current delivery-vehicle solutions, possibly enabling up to $50,000 to $80,000 improvement on return on capital over six to seven years, depending on the use case, as compared to other top selling delivery vehicles (Source). Let's now look at the skateboard technology, which we believe is one of the key differentiators for Canoo. The skateboard is a fully integrated drivable rolling chassis where the powertrain, battery technology, and electrical architecture is incorporated. It enables a variety of vehicle configurations, and faster manufacturing as the car body assembly with the skateboard only requires minimal adaptation depending on the use-case. According to management it is the Flattest and lowest profile skateboard in the industry [and] enables minimized footprint, maximized interior volume and highly modular configurations, while cutting development costs (Source). According to management the skateboard technology is the first true steer-by-wire solution that will come to market, which is differentiated from competitor offerings:  This differentiation is important since the steering mechanics are not required and allow the interior of the vehicle to be relatively larger even at similar or smaller car sizes. The steer-by-wire technology allows for a much more flexible positioning of the steering wheel at nearly any position within the vehicle, which enhances interior space. Our research found some comparable technical solutions from AEV Robotics, REE Auto, and Rivian but none seems to be having any obvious edge over Canoo‘s solution (see comparison here and here). Competitor Arrival, which is set to go public via SPAC with CIIG Merger Corp. (CIIC), also has a comparable skateboard technology but is not enabling full steer-by-wire technology. Canoo has established a partnership with Hyundai for its skateboard technology which validates the core technology offering. You can read more about the Hyundai partnership here. However, Canoo does not have any pre-ordered vehicles yet, while competitor Arrival already has a 10,000 vehicle order from UPS (Source), and earlier in 2020 Arrival also secured an investment from Hyundai (Source). This validates both company‘s technology offerings. We believe that the skateboard technology in general will see broader adoption in the EV space as it enables faster manufacturing and cost-saving potential. Interestingly, recent headlines reported that Canoo has also been in talks with Apple (AAPL) on a potential deal: The two companies are reported to have discussed options ranging from an investment by Apple to a full acquisition. The much-discussed Canoo skateboard platform drew Apple's interest per sources (Source). These headlines for potential partnerships are certainly exciting but in the end only constitute speculation for the moment. Canoo says that it has a multi-phased approach to revenue generation that includes the partnering of its engineering services, the selling of its B2B delivery vehicle, as well as the subscriptions to its other vehicle types (lifestyle and sports). Since the closure of the SPAC deal it has been quiet around Canoo and no substantial news were reported, so we don‘t have any further insights into the revenue projections compared to the information from the SPAC filings. Managament forecasts that the first revenue will not come from vehicle sales but from its engineering segment. Canoo projects $120 million in revenues for 2021 but provides little transparency on the financial details here. We can only speculate and assume that this is based largely on the Hyundai partnership plus the additional 7 pipeline projects that Canoo refers to in its investor presentation, including one with European Auto OEM (see below). There were also reports of Canoo partnering with auto manufacturer Magna which could indicate larger deals were already received for some of Canoo‘s vehicles and/or engineering services which now need to be scaled up.  Let’s take a look at Canoo’s Subscription Model: Management plans to offer access to its lifestyle and sports vehicles via a month-to-month subscription by which consumers get an all-inclusive experience that includes all costs (maintenance, insurance, vehicle charging) and requires no upfront or down-payments as is the case with conventional leasing. Management says that it wants to reduce the burden of conventional car ownership, and claims that the subscription model also reduces total cost of revenue compared to a one-time vehicle sale.  Source: Company presentation Management expects to achieve cost equivalence to a traditional lease model while offering much more fexibility and ease of use since the subscription fee contains all other hidden costs compared to a traditional lease where down payments, maintenance, registration, charging, a.o. may account for up to ~40% of additional cost.  Source: Company presentation The unit economics of the subscription offering are important, and if we believe what management is saying, should generate higher margins vs. the traditional car sales model. Canoo provides a breakdown of its financial projections in its investor presentation (see below). These projections are difficult to assess as the company is yet to launch a commercial product, and provides almost no transparency into the financials. Nevertheless, we are using these projections to build our own model.  Source: company presentation Engineering & B2B Services Revenue: as per management's forecast, first revenues are expected to come in by 2021 from the engineering segment with $120 million in projected revenue. That revenue figure should hopefully be based on a rock-solid view into Canoo’s current Hyundai partnership plus the 7 projects in the pipeline. Canoo says that revenue from this segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 39% between 2021 and 2025 and should reach >$500 million by 2025. While we believe the engineering business can become a major revenue driver for Canoo we are a little more conservative with respect to the growth estimates. It is important to mention here too, that this revenue segment will also include the B2B offerings which mostly include the sale of the delivery vehicle. You can see that from the cumulative fleet volume for subscription in the figure above were the B2B delivery vehicle is not included. In our own model we separate the engineering from the pure B2B (delivery EV sales) revenue. Let’s start with the B2B segment. Based on the pricing that was announced for the delivery vehicle starting at $33,000 and assuming management's forecasted volumes of 35,000 cumulated delivery vehicles by 2025 are valid estimates, we get to revenues of $660 million by 2025. We have calculated a downside and best-case scenario to reflect for the uncertainty around actual unit volumes and average selling price.  Source: author's calculations Our model adjusts for the average selling price of the vehicle, and we take an average selling price of $25,000 per vehicle in our downside scenario which reflects the pricing of other Class 1 EV delivery vehicles, i.e. the one from Canoo’s competitor Electric Last Mile (see below). The best-case scenario assumes an average selling price of $38,500 per vehicle which is calculated as the average price from the $33,000 initial proposed pricing for the first Canoo delivery vehicle and the currently highest priced class 2 delivery vehicle on the market with a $44,000 price tag (see below).  Source: Forum Merger Canoo‘s starting price of $33,000 fits relatively well into the price range of currently and soon-to-be available offerings from the same cargo class 2 with >200 and up to 450 FT³ Cargo Volume at a price range between $30,000 and $44,000. The pricing is however slightly above the price tag for the current Class 1 commercial vehicles, but class 1 delivery vehicles have smaller cargo volumes. In our calculations, we also take into account overall unit volumes sold for Canoo‘s delivery vehicle: in the downside scenario we assume fewer overall units sold at a cumulative 17,500 units by 2025 (vs. 35,000 per management forecast) based on slower upstart of manufacturing capacity. The best-case scenario assumes a cumulative delivery vehicle fleet of 75,000 units by 2025 based on faster manufacturing set-up and a potential larger partnership deal that would result in a ramp-up of production. Canoo forecasts a cumulative 35,000 delivery-vehicles being sold by 2025 and an additional 50,000 units for 2026. We believe this is an ambitious but attainable target, as the US delivery vehicle market alone is expected to reach roughly 1 million units by 2025 (Source). The strong push into electrification of delivery-fleets is just getting started and most recently, UPS has made a 10,000 order for delivery vehicles from UK start-up Arrival, while Amazon (AMZN) has made a 100,000 unit order from Rivian (see here). ELMS says that it already has a +30,000 unit pre-order volume for its Class 1 delivery EV which will be launched later in 2021. ELMS projects that units will rise to almost 200,000 units by 2025 (Source). This is more than double the estimated cumulative delivery vehicle fleet that we have used in our best-case scenario for Canoo and more than 5-fold the figure that Canoo's management is forecasting in their financial model by 2025. If we take into account some of the most relevant metrics for purchasing decisions, including pricing and total cargo volume, Canoo seems well positioned to take a large enough here, especially since the Canoo delivery vehicle seems to offer some competitive advantages with respect to volume efficiency, payload, and is priced competitively. Let’s now look at the engineering segment: we assume the $120 million in 2021 revenue that Canoo's management has forecasted is based on the Hyundai partnership plus the business under negotiation for the engineering segment. In the base case we use the average revenue CAGR from Canoo's forecast of 39% until 2025, while in the downside and the best-case we assume a CAGR of 25% and 50% respectively.  Source: author's calculations Our model gets to ~$300 million in revenue in the downside and ~$450 million in the base-case by 2025 for the engineering segment. Currently, we are taking a more conservative view on those projections to reflect the lack of transparency around the financials of the Hyundai partnership, and projects under negotiation. In total, this brings the potential combined revenue from the B2B and Engineering segments in our model close to ~$1.1bn in our base case and ~$540 million in the downside by 2025. Let's now look at the subscription revenue segment: Canoo plans to produce a cumulative lifestyle vehicle unit volume of 135,000 by 2025. The sports EV, which will also be part of the subscription offering, is expected to launch in 2025 with an initial 25,000 units and 50,000 units by 2026. In total that's a cumulative 160,000 EV units for 2025 that can be used for the subscription offering. If we take the cumulative fleet volume units and assume the average subscription price per month is in the $600 to $700 range, with a roughly 9-month average subscription duration, we get to a revenue figure from subscriptions of >$900 million by 2025 in our base case (see model below).   The revenue estimates are largely affected by the assumptions on vehicle unit volumes, as well as duration and price of the subscription offering. In our model we have built a downside and best-case scenario to account for these uncertainties. For the EV unit volumes, we take a more conservative view and assume EV units will be lower than management’s forecast. With respect to the pricing of the subscription offering, this was recently discussed in another SA article and assumed to be in the $900 per month range. In our model, we assume the $900 price tag to be a rather optimistic view of the willingness-to-pay threshold, especially since the subscription offering will be a relatively new experience of car ownership. We build our base scenario on a $650 price / month and the downside assumes a $450 / month pricing for the subscription offering. We have also taken a look at the current leasing rates for the Tesla Model 3 which comes in at a $631 price tag, with no downpayment (similar as for Canoo), and a minimum leasing duration of 36 months (note that Canoo‘s minimum subscription duration is only 1 month and thereby offers more flexibility).   Source: Tesla For the average subscription duration we assume an average of 6, 9, and 12 months for the respective scenarios. The worst case reflects some of the uncertainty around consumer adoption of the subscription offering, and the best-case assumes full capacity utilization per unit for 11 months per year, while we take into account 1 month per year for maintenance where the vehicle would be out of service. In our model, the volume unit forecast for both the B2C and B2B segment are important drivers of projected revenue. Since the unit volumes from Canoo's different segments are difficult to appraise, we are taking a look at the Global EV forecasts by vehicle types to assess the probability of Canoo’s estimates. Deloitte and Bloomberg have published research reports on the Global EV markets and their projected unit developments in major regions. Deloitte highlights a CAGR of 29% over the next 10 years as total EV sales are expected to grow from 2.5 million units sold in 2020 to >11 million units sold in 2025, and roughly 10-fold to 31 million units by 2030 (see here).  Source: Deloitte A Bloomberg report forecasts that the share of total Global EV car sales could reach roughly 10-11% share by 2025 and 28% by 2030, which would represent between 8 to 10 million units by 2025 and 25 million by 2030.  Source: Bloomberg Another report from IEA sees global electric vehicle stock growing between 20% to 36% annually, reaching between 140 million to 245 million vehicles in 2030 – more than 30 times above today’s level on the upside (assuming government policy tailwinds). Strongest growth is expected for the light-duty vehicle segment where electric powertrain technologies, including Canoo’s offering, are most readily available. By 2030 it is assumed that the global electric vehicle stock (excluding two/three-wheelers) accounts for at least 7% of the global vehicle fleet if not more, up from about 1% of global car stock in 2019.   Source: IEA report Canoo's lifestyle vehicle is projected at 135,000 cumulative units sold by 2025, plus an additional 25,000 sports type EVs starting in 2025. Assuming Canoo can double its production capacity by 2030 to ~300,000 that would represent ~0.025% of the Global EV PLDV (= passenger light-duty vehicle) stock by 2030 reflecting the most conservative scenario from IEA above. Obviously, China, Europe and other regions are still included in those estimates, so the pure US market that Canoo is going after in its initial launch is smaller. While those estimates carry many uncertainties, we believe Canoo's projected unit volumes are attainable since we believe that Canoo has a possible technology advantage. The largest uncertainty will be the level of adoption for the subscription offering vs. the conventional ownership or leasing models. We see actual unit volumes to be lower vs. Canoo’s forecast and somewhere between the base- and downside case assumptions from our model. Let's now look at the delivery vehicle segment and projected unit volumes. The global electric commercial vehicle market is expected to reach roughly 1 million units by 2025 (Source) and 2 million units by 2028, growing at a CAGR of >40%, mostly due to the strong growth of e-commerce (Source). In fact, many leading e-commerce and logistics companies have already started or announced to adopt EV solutions for their delivery fleets: UPS has made a 10,000 order for delivery vehicles from UK start-up Arrival (Source) and Amazon has made a 100,000 unit order from Rivian (Source). IEA states that the market for EV LCV (= light commercial vehicles) will reach around ~16 million in stock unit volume by 2030 in the conservative scenario (Source). Canoo projects unit volumes of 35,000 delivery vehicles by 2025 and 85,000 by 2026. Assuming the capacity can double to 170,000 units by 2030, this would represent a ~1% Global market share. Again, other regions are still included in those estimates, so the pure US market will be smaller. Still, we believe this represents a reasonable estimate for Canoo due to the potential technology advantage. Any larger partnership deal with the likes of Amazon, UPS, FedEx or other larger players in the e-commerce segment would probably result in a short-term upside to these assumptions. Let's now close the loop and look at the combined revenue projection for Canoo based on our model. Overall, when adding the Engineering & B2B plus the Subscription Revenue segment together, we get to the following total revenue estimates for 2025:  Our base-case of ~$2bn revenue by 2025 compares to ~$2.3bn in revenue that Canoo's management is forecasting. Due to the large uncertainties around some of the underlying assumptions, especially with respect to unit volumes and lack of transparency on the details of revenue projections, we are taking a more conservative view and leave out the best-case scenario for our valuation estimate. We assume 2025 revenue to be in the middle of our base- and downside scenario. That would be be roughly $1.4bn in revenue by 2025. At the closing price of ~$11 from March 5th Canoo trades at a ~$2.6 market capitalization based on 235.7 million shares outstanding. This brings the forward market cap / sales ratio to ~1.9 for 2025 based on our projected revenue of ~$1.4bn. We believe that the recent pullback in Canoo’s stock price puts shares in a relatively attractive price zone comopared to some of the other early-stage EV companies. Before we get to the conclusion, let’s also take a quick look at Canoo’s management: one key aspect of why we believe Canoo is more than a nice-looking idea on a PowerPoint presentation is its strong management team. Canoo's current CEO Ulrich Kranz is an automotive industry veteran with >30 years of executive experience at BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY) (Source). The recently appointed Executive Chairman, Tony Aquila, is a serial entrepreneur who founded Solera Holdings Inc. which he brought public at a $1 billion IPO, followed by multiple acquisitions that finally resulted in Solera going private again at a $6.5bn valuation in 2016. The CTO Peter Savagian also brings a multi-year experience from the car industry and served in various roles at General Motors for more than 10 years. The CFO Mr. Balciunas served, amongst others, as VP Global Automotive Investment Banking at Deutsche Bank AG for roughly 10 years. Canoo has yet to launch a commercially viable product, let alone generate any revenue. Unfortunately, the company does not provide any transparency around its revenue projections, especially for its partnership with Hyundai. Similarly, talks with Apple provide nice headlines but in the end don‘t result in any revenues. The largest risk is that Canoo's plans and the underlying financial forecast are simply too optimistic and management fails to close any partnerships for its engineering or B2B offerings. Similarly, its own lifestyle EVs might not get the required customer adoption, either due to production delays and/or lack of customer adoption of its subscription offering, which is a fairly new go-to-market strategy. While we believe that the company will have sufficient cash to fund its operations in the short-term, the fact that Canoo is basically pursuing multiple projects in parallel will sooner or later result in further capital requirements and equity dilution via share offerings which would negatively impact the share price in the short-term. The business combination with HCAC brought in ~$600 million to Canoo’s balance sheet. While that is certainly a good start it will not be sufficient to fund costly manufacturing for a very long time. Investors should carefully watch how operating expenses develop once the company starts commercial production of its vehicles. Source: Canoo Another aspect to consider is that Canoo has a lot of competition from established and well-capitalized players like Tesla (TSLA), Ford (F), General Motors (GM) but also from EV start-ups like Fisker (FSR), Lordstown (RIDE), ELMS (FIII), Arrival (CIIC), Lucid (CCIV) and many others. The recent share price declines in many of those names show that even the much-hyped EV industry is not immune to significant downside pressure despite their bright future. These declines might continue to accelerate as rates in the US continue to rise and fears of inflation weigh on investor sentiment. We believe the recent declines in the public EV names were a confirmation that valuations have simply gone up too far while uncertainties around capitalization and abilities for mass-production were simply neglected by investors over the past months. Canoo will ultimately need to raise further capital to compete and accelerate its production plans. Furthermore, the company needs to prove that it can get deals closed for the Engineering & B2B segment, including commitments for the delivery vehicle from larger companies in the e-commerce and transportation segment. While all of the above estimates carry significant risks, the key takeaway for investors is that Canoo does not need to become the next Tesla or Ford to be a successful company and investment. This was recently highlighted by another SA article. We believe that even at more conservative targets derived from our model, Canoo is still positioned to benefit from the large-scale EV adoption and may generate above-average returns for patient investors on the basis of current valuations. The reason to believe is two-fold: Canoo has a potential technology edge and its management is rock-solid which should open up multiple partnership avenues in the future. Despite all the positives Canoo has yet to launch a commercially viable product, let alone generate any revenue. The fact that Canoo is an early-stage company, any investment should be viewed as speculative only, with the risk of complete loss if the company fails to deliver on its strategy. It is up to the individual investor to decide whether these risks are bearable. While Canoo’s stock price declined substantially from its highs, we have initiated a speculative and small (<1% of our portfolio) long position in the company as we await further updates from management.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC.

from 8 AM - 10 PM ET News provided by 14 Aug, 2023, 16:59 ET Share this article JUSTIN, Texas, Aug. 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Canoo Inc. (Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech advanced mobility company, today announced its financial results for the second quarter of 2023. ""We are pleased to close the chapter involving the legacy SEC matter.  Today we introduced the LDV 190, which has been in development for some time, including in customer trials.  Our facilities are nearing substantial completion as we've achieved a 20,000 unit run rate for our battery module line in Pryor and robotics and assembly line in Oklahoma City for our MPP1 platform. And we closed another Fortune 100 customer agreement to purchase vehicles for its national fleet. We entered the revenue and income generation phase with the advancement of our contract with the Department of Defense, and we delivered vehicles to NASA, "" said Tony Aquila, Chairman and CEO at Canoo. Second Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Second Quarter Financial Highlights: Second Half 2023 Business Outlook Based upon our current projections, Canoo expects: See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, August 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET. To listen to the conference call via telephone dial (877) 407-9169 (U.S.) and (201) 493-6755 (international callers/U.S. toll) and enter the conference ID number 13740414.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

Read online Read online Read online Read online Read online There were 10 million electric cars on the world’s roads at the end of 2020, following a decade of rapid growth. Electric car registrations increased by 41% in 2020, despite the pandemic-related worldwide downturn in car sales in which global car sales dropped 16%. Around 3 million electric cars were sold globally (a 4.6% sales share), and Europe overtook the People’s Republic of China (“China”) as the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) market for the first time. Electric bus and truck registrations also expanded in major markets, reaching global stocks of 600 000 and 31 000 respectively. The resilience of EV sales in the face of the pandemic rests on three main pillars: Vehicle manufacturers announced increasingly ambitious electrification plans. Out of the world’s top 20 vehicle manufacturers, which represented around 90% of new car registrations in 2020, 18 have stated plans to widen their portfolio of models and to rapidly scale up the production of light-duty electric vehicles. The model availability of electric heavy-duty vehicles is also broadening, with four major truck manufacturers indicating an all-electric future. Consumer spending on electric car purchases increased to USD 120 billion in 2020. In parallel, governments across the world spent USD 14 billion to support electric car sales, up 25% from 2019, mostly from stronger incentives in Europe. Nonetheless, the share of government incentives in total spending on electric cars has decreased over the past five years, suggesting that EVs are becoming increasingly attractive to consumers. The near-term outlook for EV sales is bright. In the first-quarter of 2021, global electric car sales rose by around 140% compared to the same period in 2020, driven by sales in China of around 500 000 vehicles and in Europe of around 450 000. US sales more than doubled relative to the first-quarter of 2020, albeit from a much lower base. Existing policies around the world suggest healthy growth over this decade: in the Stated Policies Scenario, the EV stock across all modes (except two/three-wheelers) reaches 145 million in 2030, accounting for 7% of the road vehicle fleet. EV markets could be significantly larger if governments accelerate efforts to reach climate goals. In the Sustainable Development Scenario, the global EV fleet reaches 230 million vehicles in 2030 (excluding two/three-wheelers), a stock share of 12%. The expanding fleet of EVs will continue to reduce well-to-wheel GHG emissions, with the net savings relative to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles increasing over time depending on the pace at which electricity generation decarbonises. In 2030, in the Stated Policies Scenario, the global EV fleet reduces GHG emissions by more than one-third compared to an equivalent ICE vehicle fleet; in the Sustainable Development Scenario, the level rises to two-thirds. Even with the recent success of EV deployment, reaching a trajectory consistent with climate goals is a formidable challenge. It requires stronger ambition and action from all countries. Advances in battery technology and mass manufacturing will continue to drive down the cost of EVs. But the 2020s will need to see more than just the mass adoption of electric light-duty vehicles to meet climate goals. Governments will also need to put in place policies to promote the roll-out of zero-emission vehicles in the medium- and heavy-duty vehicle segments and the correponding fast-charging infrastructure. In the short term, countries can continue to implement, enforce and tighten measures such as CO2 and fuel economy standards and EV mandates.Taxing gasoline and diesel at rates that reflect their environmental and human health impacts can provide government revenue, reduce their negative impacts and hasten the transition to electric mobility. Differentiated taxation of vehicles and fuels that reflect their environmental performance can further align markets with the climate benefits of EVs. In order for electric vehicles to attain their full potential to mitigate carbon emissions, critical progress is required to decarbonise electricity generation, to integrate electric vehicles in power systems, to build charging infrastructure and to advance sustainable battery manufacturing and their recycling.

From my perspective, leading an electrical components manufacturer for nearly a decade, I have seen the rapid growth of the EV space firsthand. At the outset, I was optimistic about the growth potential of the EV sector. Today, I’m ecstatic. Just look at some of the numbers: In the first half of 2022, the electric vehicle sector saw a 62% increase in global sales over the same period in 2021. The U.S. electric vehicle market is projected to grow to $137.43 billion by 2028, for a compound annual growth rate of 25.4%, while the worldwide market will grow to an estimated $858 billion by 2027. Consulting leaders McKinsey & Co. say EVs will largely dominate the truck market by 2035, and Mordor Intelligence forecasts that the commercial EV market will grow to roughly $258 billion by 2027 (compared to around $67 billion in 2021). In response, almost every major manufacturer is retooling production lines for a largely EV future. Those trends have many suppliers eager to break into the electrification scene, but few know how to effectively penetrate the market. When we committed to breaking into the electric vehicle market in 2015, we were well positioned for the space because of our experience in designing and manufacturing for safety-critical sectors such as aerospace, defense and medical devices. We also did extensive research on the electric vehicle industry. Today, I often hear from executives in the manufacturing or services sector considering the same questions we faced then. The first is whether to move toward the EV market in the first place. I recommend they start by asking themselves a simple question: Do you believe that vehicle electrification is the future? Once you are committed to this rapid transformation, you can begin to discover ways in which your business can contribute to the industry. Next, they want to know, “How do I break into the EV space, especially when my core expertise is in other segments?” or “How am I going to get customers in this space?” Some want to know how they apply their previous expertise to the EV space, while others are seeking ways to set their business apart from all the other players. I advise the following steps: 1. Do your homework. I advise company leaders to spend substantial time researching the current services and products that are in demand within the EV space. Great ways to conduct said research include attending conferences, listening to industry discussions on a variety of topics and learning about electric vehicles and their architecture. I would recommend absorbing everything from how the vehicles are made to the individual players involved to gain a true understanding of the industry. Go beyond your comfort level when it comes to complex subject matters. Everybody knows electric vehicles have batteries and that they run on an electric motor. But how does everything connect? How does it all work as one, cohesive piece of technology? How do the operators of these vehicles use them and what requirements are they looking for? These are the questions I encourage newcomers to answer themselves. 2. Identify industry needs. At this stage, the line of questioning changes a bit. This is where I believe business owners should be asking themselves, “Which companies are manufacturing products for the space? What are the goals of these manufacturers, and why do they have these goals?” This is an opportune time to reflect on the current value that your business brings to customers. Once you have done so, this is a great time to ask the next question: Given my existing value proposition, what can we contribute to this space? For example, maybe you lead a metal fabrication business and you have years of experience fabricating high-precision metal parts for aerospace. You need to identify how to leverage these competencies in an electric platform. You could look at which high-precision parts are needed to power electric vehicles, and let’s say it turns out that there is one very high-precision part that is always included in electric vehicle battery packs. Because you understand both the architecture of the EV and are well aware of the major manufacturers in the space, you can now identify the value of the battery pack opportunity. 3. Supply the demand. Continuing with our high-precision metal parts example above, upon delving into the internal structure of said battery packs, you realize that the development of this product would relate to a core competency of your existing business. You can now begin to take the steps necessary to identify customers, determine value proposition, produce prototypes and hopefully produce these items at a high volume to meet the growing demand of the EV industry. 4. Speak up. This tip is very important: In my experience, you should never be afraid to reach out to companies that have already achieved success within the EV space (that are not competitors of course!). As I mentioned, the sector is still very much expanding. I am constantly talking to industry newcomers about what roles their existing businesses could play within the market and am happy to provide them with realistic resources and investment guidance that is required to get their new operation off the ground. 5. Embrace change. Internal changes are necessary. There is no way around this. You will need to onboard more teams, enhance your engineering efforts and increase the number of hands you have working in sales, quality control, manufacturing and any other department within your business that will help you work with these types of products and build out the new segment of your business. Breaking into a new-to-you industry may seem daunting, but it’s an exciting time in the electric vehicle industry. Apply these tips and remember: Without risk, there is no reward!

If not for the economic fallout of the pandemic causing massive global inflation and reactionary spikes in interest rates over the past 12 months, the automotive industry may have had a much easier time convincing consumers to join them on a journey to electrification. As it stands, achieving the US federal government’s target of having electric vehicles (EVs) represent 50% of light vehicle sales by 20301 could be seen as ambitious when they represented just 7.2% of new vehicle demand in the second quarter of this year (up from 5.7% last year).2 The pace of change should accelerate dramatically over the next six years, but several challenges persist, including affordability, infrastructure, supply chain evolution, and the likelihood of production disruptions resulting from upcoming labor negotiations. Light vehicle affordability is not a new concern. Transaction prices in the United States have been ratcheting up for over a decade. However, a market-wide shift to inherently more expensive light trucks, coupled with the rapid rise in borrowing costs and the introduction of electrification technology, has collided with a consumer concern for financial capacity in a protracted period of high inflation. The latest results from Deloitte Global State of the Consumer Tracker study suggest half of US consumers are concerned about the amount of money they have saved and nearly one-third are worried about their credit card debt. While less than a quarter of consumers are concerned about making upcoming payments, less than half of survey respondents (46%) report having money left over at the end of the month, and only four in 10 can afford a large, unexpected expense. As a result, the Deloitte vehicle purchase intent index has remained well below the baseline (set in October 2021) for the past year, suggesting underlying softness in core consumer sentiment, which is currently being masked by efforts to replenish dealer inventories (figure 1). It may also reflect the rising level of incentives required to keep people engaged in the vehicle market.3 Although new vehicle transaction prices have moderated slightly since the start of the year, averaging US$48,334 in July,4 there is still a large gap between this market reality and what consumers expect to pay for their next vehicle. Results from the 2023 Deloitte Global Automotive Consumer Study suggest that more than two-thirds (68%) of consumers expect to pay less than US$50,000 the next time they are in the market for a new vehicle. Even more striking is the apparent disconnect between the average monthly payment for a new vehicle, which reached a record of US$733 in the second quarter of this year (up from US$678 in the same quarter a year prior),5 and that 80% of new vehicle intenders expect to pay less than US$600 per month (figure 2).6 It should be noted that healthy purchase incentives contained in the Inflation Reduction Act and a raft of price cuts implemented earlier this year have been supportive of EV sales growth. Some automakers are also promising more moderately priced electric models that will likely be introduced to the market over the next few years.7 However, many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are finding it difficult to offer EVs at an affordable yet profitable price. The key to improving the cost equation includes the rapid developments being made in battery chemistry using lower-cost materials, and the application of giga-presses designed to dramatically reduce complexity in the vehicle manufacturing process.8 Another hurdle to overcome is building an effective, affordable, and reliable national EV charging network. As recent Deloitte consumer survey data shows, 46% of consumers cite the lack of public charging infrastructure as their greatest concern regarding battery electric vehicles.9 Further, 40% of consumers cite the lack of a home charger as their biggest concern, and although the majority of people intending to acquire an EV expect to charge their vehicle at home, nearly a quarter will be relying on access to a public charger, as the cost of installing a private charger is prohibitive.10 At the moment, the United States has around 32,000 public DC fast chargers. However, to support the expected number of EVs in operation by 2030, the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that the number will have to grow to 182,000.11 Again, the federal government is making funds available for the build-out of this infrastructure, but more coordinated oversight may be required to help ensure optimal placement of chargers. It also appears that OEMs are finally acknowledging that a more standardized approach to charging technology is necessary to drive mass EV adoption.12 It is also important that these chargers are functional and reliable. Having said that, a recent study data suggests consumer satisfaction with publicly available chargers declined in Q2 of this year compared to the same period a year ago.13 The main drivers of dissatisfaction include charging speed, inoperable chargers, and long queues at charging locations. Access to federal infrastructure funds is also predicated on that fact that chargers need to be functional 97% of the time,14 but some questions remain regarding how this will likely be achieved and/or monitored, as reports suggest current performance remains well below that mark.15 From a supply chain perspective, the transition to EVs can be likened to the analogy of changing the engines on an airplane while in flight. For suppliers that have traditionally been dependent on vehicle assembly volume in a piece price environment, the production slowdowns experienced over the last two years, sparked by the semiconductor crisis, have been difficult to endure. Many suppliers were unable to renegotiate contracts with their OEM customers and were left to take on a significant amount of debt.16 At the same time, the need to innovate and keep pace with the OEMs’ transition to EVs has applied even more pressure on suppliers at a time when the cost of borrowing to fund capital investments has risen substantially. Vehicle production and sales are expected to rebound over the next two years, which should help suppliers as pandemic-induced pent-up demand is released into the market. However, the second half of the decade is predicted to look very different as demand stagnation sets in, limiting light vehicle sales to 16–16.5 million units per year (figure 3).17 Overall, as demand for light vehicles begins to recede, industry stakeholders may need to rethink their business models and service offerings to compensate for lower revenue and profitability contribution emanating from the sale of vehicles to end consumers. Several OEMs are attempting to lay the foundation for digital service offerings in conjunction with the introduction of new EVs in the marketplace. A big question is whether consumers will pay for added connectivity and digital services.18 Recent study results show that consumers are interested in services that optimize their journey, suggesting alternate routes to minimize travel time while improving road safety.19 However, wrestling consumers away from high-tech players that have embedded many of these features into value-added smartphone apps for over a decade may be a significant challenge for OEMs looking to monetize these services. Vehicle retailers also have a role to play in the mainstream adoption of EVs and should help ensure their personnel are proficient when it comes to the unique aspects of selling and maintaining EVs. EV vehicle production may also face a near-term derailment because of the already contentious upcoming labor negotiations.20 On the one hand, the economics of producing vehicles may be impacted by substantial wage increases and other demands put forward by union leadership. On the other hand, OEMs may use the negotiations to affect major changes in their manufacturing footprint that align to longer-term EV transformation strategies. Either way, the outcome of this year’s collective bargaining efforts may have a significant impact on the transition to EVs in North America. There is no doubt that the US automotive industry is on the path to an electric mobility future, but getting there will likely not be a leisurely walk in the park. Many obstacles threaten the path to electrification where each step is important, given the role the automotive sector is being asked to play in the global decarbonization effort. The need for a variety of stakeholders across the automotive ecosystem to converge with a common goal to help solve these issues will likely be essential to maintain momentum.

Executives  expect operating expenses to be between $55 and  $70 million and capital expenditures between $30 and $45 million, both reductions  from 2022 goals. “Migrating from an R&D design and premarket delivery to  a manufacturing and market launch organization hitting these milestones will  better help us manage the current market turbulence,” he said. Ramping up production in 2023 means hitting a 20,000-unit run  rate at its Oklahoma City factory, a number executives have held firm on since  Q3. Canoo currently has a $2.8 billion order book, including 4,500 vans to be  used as Walmart delivery vehicles. Aquila’s  affirmation of Canoo’s production target stands in contrast with Arrival,  another EV commercial vehicle startup, which had to dial  back its ambitions over the past year (On a related note, General Motors Corp.'s  BrightDrop division will this year deliver the first 200 of 4,000 electric vans  to Ryder System Inc.). But Canoo still has work to do: When asked about the current  level of preparedness, Aquila said they were in the “65%-ish range of items on  the ground, probably at north of 85% with what's inbound,” although they’d  found a workflow that supported their confidence in achieving it. Canoo announced its Q4 results on  March 30, which showed it failed to generate any revenue in the quarter and  experienced a comprehensive loss of $82 million, compared to $138.1 million in  Q4 2021, and $487.7 million for the year, compared to $346.8 million last year.  The company posted a going concern at the end of Q1, as it lost $125 million in  the period and had less than that in cash left. Q4 also saw Canoo settle the  SEC investigation into whether former senior executives had misled investors,  and the company will pay a $1.5 million fine as result. Despite the lows of the year,  executives remained optimistic about the big picture. They delivered Canoo’s first  light tactical vehicle (LTV) to the U.S. Army and entered a partnership with a  Saudi Arabian distribution company. With the investigation wrapped up, Aquila said Canoo can now apply for government programs such as the “Department of Energy loan program and  things of that nature.” After  reporting earnings, Canoo stock (Ticker: GOEV) fell from trading at $0.62 per  share to $0.60 the following day, although it ended up rising to $0.69 that  same day. Over the past six months, they have continued a general downward  trend, currently trading 66% lower than the Oct. 2022 high."

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business. Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches, potential success of, and ability to accelerate its, go-to-market strategy, and Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond Canoo's control. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business; the ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations""  in Canoo's registration statement on Form S-1 filed on January 13, 2021, and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus contained therein, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 to be filed with the SEC on or before March 31, 2021, as well as its other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or Canoo's assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so unless required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. 1 Reflects the 40kWh base variant of the Canoo MPDV1.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

24,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-irresistible-momentum-behind-clean-electric-connected-mobility-four-key-trends,Four key trends in electric cars and mobility | McKinsey,"General Motors’ January announcement that it would join other automakers by selling only zero-emission vehicles (in its case, by 2035) was one of the most well-publicized examples of something that has become crystal clear over the past few years: the momentum behind cleaner, software-enabled forms of mobility is powerful and seemingly unstoppable. What does this mean for companies and consumers? In this article, we’ll look at four trends that illustrate the way this new form of transformation will develop: the increasing support of capital markets; the kinds of features these vehicles will have, as seen by the demands of Chinese consumers; the speed needed for this transition to contribute meaningfully to the slowing of climate change; and the impact this shift will have on labor markets. by Kersten Heineke, Timo Möller, Asutosh Padhi, Dennis Schwedhelm, and Andreas Tschiesner Over the past year and a half, the mobility industry has significantly outperformed top-performing industries, such as semiconductors and big tech, in capital markets. We think this reflects that new mobility start-ups are doing six key things right: Traditional auto companies will compete fiercely to capture a healthy portion of these new value pools. Hybrids and EVs have been part of their portfolios for a long time now, and they are rapidly accelerating their efforts to win subscription revenue and think software-first. Whether those efforts are enough for capital markets to reward them too remains an open question.

In fact, your experience inside the car is in many ways just an extension of your experience outside the car. New Chinese automakers have tapped into advanced technologies to deliver a customer journey that is friendly and convenient, starting with online sales, which are the norm in China. But the experience is truly differentiated when you climb into the driver’s seat. Advanced facial-recognition systems using in-vehicle cameras kick in immediately, adjusting the seat, steering wheel, and interior lighting to your preferred settings. A customized avatar on the central dashboard screen greets you and even offers up restaurant recommendations if you say that you’re looking for someplace to eat. If you want to change the music during your drive, just say so. Chinese automakers have also improved on charging and parking: valet charging services will drive the car to a charging station during your work hours and return it to your parking spot before your commute home. And if you do have to charge the car yourself, you can pay for it from the infotainment screen, which has many of the features and apps that you get on your smartphone. These developments may not seem as significant as, say, electrification itself. But they have the potential to be hugely significant. Chinese consumers are willing to pay twice as much as their Western peers for such features. Electrification may eventually become the expected norm, just as gasoline-powered engines did. But connected, consumer-friendly features have the potential to woo customers—in China, 56 percent of consumers say they’d be willing to change brands for better connectivity. OEMs around the world would be wise to pay attention to that statistic. It may well be that the differentiating feature in the car of the future will be its ability to mimic the conveniences we’ve come to expect from our smartphones.

Reducing carbon emissions from vehicles is critical—currently, road transport accounts for 13 percent of global carbon emissions. To understand the depth of the challenge, consider that the pace of technology development of mobility is already quite fast. The cost of EV batteries, for example, is now just $100 per kilowatt-hour, down from $1,200 in 2010. Investment in EV-related technologies and assets almost doubled in 2020. And yet these advancements still aren’t enough to ensure that we’ll hit the 1.5°C climate targets. The decade between 2025 and 2035 will determine whether the industry can keep cumulative CO2 emissions for passenger cars (through 2050) to under 45 gigatons, a “carbon budget” that would help hold global temperature increases to under 1.5°C, according to McKinsey analysis. Mobility players, consumers, and governments face five challenges: None of this will be easy. Holding emissions under the 45 gigaton target will require a cross-industry effort among companies, industries, and government. For instance, the energy and transport sectors can work together to drive smart-charging technologies that would in turn accelerate the shift to EVs. Coalitions can be formed to develop clean supply chains for the creation of low-carbon battery solutions that reflect the full potential of a circular economy. Ultimately, regulators and policy makers may have to intercede, adopting an ecosystem perspective with cross-border goals and meaningful timelines for everything from number of charge points needed to the trajectory of carbon reduction. Without this kind of cooperation, it’s unlikely that the shift to EVs will realize its full potential for creating a sustainable battery value chain and for mitigating the impact of climate change. About the author(s) Julian Conzade is a consultant in McKinsey’s Munich office, where Patrick Schaufuss is a partner; Russell Hensley is a partner in the Detroit office. by Björn Hagemann, Ruth Heuss, and Kirsten Weerda Over the next five to ten years, the skill sets of traditional automakers and suppliers will need to shift dramatically. Several factors will drive this change. The rising importance of in-vehicle software and connected and autonomous cars increases the need for digital talent, putting OEMs worldwide in direct competition with Silicon Valley and the Chinese digital giants. But the shift isn’t merely an issue of seeking out new kinds of engineers. Drawing from thousands of existing databases, we created a taxonomy of the future skills the industry will need. Based on that work, we believe that demand for workers with today’s standard skill sets will drop by up to 30 percent in the coming decade. A reduction of employees could occur across the entire automotive value chain. As consumers become increasingly comfortable buying everything online, existing dealer networks could shrink dramatically and shift their focus to maintenance. Manufacturing could take a similar hit, driven mostly by OEMs shifting to EVs with simpler assembly processes and very different parts. Both factory workers and current powertrain suppliers will be affected. Existing large-scale combustion-engineering departments will no longer be needed after 2030—EVs require engineers with more electrical skills and an understanding of battery chemistry. As with many other industries, up to 50 percent of some support-function tasks, such as accounting or order processing, are likely to be fully automated. And for those tasks that can’t be automated, we may see the creation of shared service centers in low-cost locations, now that companies are more skilled at using digital tools and more comfortable with remote work because of the pandemic. New skills will be needed, especially in software and data analytics, which will be critical for online sales and marketing channels. We believe automakers can close up to half of the skills gap organically, by way of reskilling, continuous education, and hiring. M&A and strategic partnerships, already a core aspect of the mobility ecosystem, will also play a big role. Every automaker needs a strategic workforce plan that identifies critical roles and skills at every level in the organization, and matches the right talent to the most value-creating roles. This would be a big shift from the traditional succession and talent management processes of OEMs, which have focused on the top tiers of the company. This skills transformation will demand a culture transformation as well. Automakers will have to provide the kind of employee experience that top talent has come to expect at tech companies, which means approachable managers, speedy hiring and onboarding, agile-work and fast-decision processes using QBRs [quarterly business reviews] and OKRs [objectives and key results] methodologies, compensation and incentives tied to talent rather than hierarchy, and an acceptance of flexible and remote work. All in all, the changes to the automotive workforce are likely to be as extensive as the changes coming to the vehicles they manufacture.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.  CANOO INC.

IEA (2021), Global EV Outlook 2021, IEA, Paris https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2021, Licence: CC BY 4.0 Global After a decade of rapid growth, in 2020 the global electric car stock hit the 10 million mark, a 43% increase over 2019, and representing a 1% stock share. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for two-thirds of new electric car registrations and two-thirds of the stock in 2020. China, with 4.5 million electric cars, has the largest fleet, though in 2020 Europe had the largest annual increase to reach 3.2 million. Overall the global market for all types of cars was significantly affected by the economic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first part of 2020 saw new car registrations drop about one-third from the preceding year. This was partially offset by stronger activity in the second-half, resulting in a 16% drop overall year-on-year. Notably, with conventional and overall new car registrations falling, global electric car sales share rose 70% to a record 4.6% in 2020. About 3 million new electric cars were registered in 2020. For the first time, Europe led with 1.4 million new registrations. China followed with 1.2 million registrations and the United States registered 295 000 new electric cars. Numerous factors contributed to increased electric car registrations in 2020. Notably, electric cars are gradually becoming more competitive in some countries on a total cost of ownership basis. Several governments provided or extended fiscal incentives that buffered electric car purchases from the downturn in car markets. Europe Overall Europe’s car market contracted 22% in 2020. Yet, new electric car registrations more than doubled to 1.4 million representing a sales share of 10%. In the large markets, Germany registered 395 000 new electric cars and France registered 185 000.  The United Kingdom more than doubled registrations to reach 176 000. Electric cars in Norway reached a record high sales share of 75%, up about one-third from 2019. Sales shares of electric cars exceeded 50% in Iceland, 30% in Sweden and reached 25% in the Netherlands. This surge in electric car registrations in Europe despite the economic slump reflect two policy measures. First, 2020 was the target year for the European Union’s CO2 emissions standards that limit the average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per kilometre driven for new cars. Second, many European governments increased subsidy schemes for EVs as part of stimulus packages to counter the effects of the pandemic. In European countries, BEV registrations accounted for 54% of electric car registrations in 2020, continuing to exceed those of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, the BEV registration level doubled from the previous year while the PHEV level thripled. The share of BEVs was particularly high in the Netherlands (82% of all electric car registrations), Norway (73%), United Kingdom (62%) and France (60%). China The overall car market in China was impacted by the panademic less than other regions. Total new car registrations were down about 9%. Registration of new electric cars was lower than the overall car market in the first-half of 2020. This trend reversed in the second-half as China constrained the panademic. The result was a sales share of 5.7%, up from 4.8% in 2019. BEVs were about 80% of new electric cars registered. Key policy actions muted the incentives for the electric car market in China. Purchase subsidies were initially due to expire at the end of 2020, but following signals that they would be phased out more gradually prior to the pandemic, by April 2020 and in the midst of the pandemic, they were instead cut by 10% and exended through 2022. Reflecting economic concerns related to the pandemic, several cities relaxed car licence policies, allowing for more internal combustion engines vehicles to be registered to support local car industries. United States The US car market declined 23% in 2020, though electric car registrations fell less than the overall market. In 2020, 295 000 new electric cars were registered, of which about 78% were BEVs, down from 327 000 in 2019. Their sales share nudged up to 2%. Federal incentives decreased in 2020 due to the federal tax credits for Tesla and General Motors, which account for the majority of electric car registrations, reaching their limit. Other countries Electric car markets in other countries were resilent in 2020. For example, in Canada the new car market shrunk 21% while new electric car registrations were broadly unchanged from the previous year at 51 000. New Zealand is a notable exception. In spite of its strong pandemic response, it saw a decline of 22% in new electric car registrations in 2020, in line with a car market decline of 21%. The decline seems to be largely related to exceptionally low EV registrations in April 2020 when New Zealand was in lockdown. Another exception is Japan, where the overall new car market contracted 11% from the 2019 level while electric car registrations declined 25% in 2020. The electric car market in Japan has fallen in absolute and relative terms every year since 2017, when it peaked at 54 000 registrations and a 1% sales share. In 2020, there were 29 000 registrations and a 0.6% sales share. Consumer spending Consumers spent USD 120 billion on electric car purchases in 2020, a 50% increase from 2019, which breaks down to a 41% increase in sales and a 6% rise in average prices. The rise in average prices reflects that Europe, where prices are higher on average than in Asia, accounted for a bigger proportion of new electric car registrations. In 2020, the global average BEV price was around USD 40 000 and around USD 50 000 for a PHEV. Government spending Governments across the world spent USD 14 billion on direct purchase incentives and tax deductions for electric cars in 2020, a 25% rise year-on-year. Despite this, the share of government incentives in total spending on EVs has been on a downward slide from roughly 20% in 2015 to 10% in 2020. All the increase in government spending was in Europe, where many countries responded to the pandemic-induced economic downturn with incentive schemes that boosted electric car sales. In China, government spending decreased as the eligibility requirements for incentive programmes tightened. An important novelty in subsidy schemes was the introduction of price caps in Europe and China, i.e. no subsidy given for vehicles with prices above a certain threshold. This might be responsible for average electric car price falling in Europe and China: BEV cars sold in China were 3% cheaper in 2020 than in 2019, while PHEV cars in Europe were 8% cheaper. Worldwide about 370 electric car models were available in 2020, a 40% increase from 2019. China has the widest offering, reflecting its  less consolidated automotive sector and that it is the world’s largest EV market. But in 2020 the biggest increase in number of models was in Europe where it  more than doubled. BEV models are offered in most vehicle segments in all regions; PHEVs are skewed towards larger vehicle segments. Sport utility vehicle (SUV) models account for half of the available electric car models in all markets. China has nearly twice as many electric car models available as the European Union, which has more than twice as many electric models as the United States. This difference can partially be explained by the comparatively lower maturity of the US EV market, reflecting its weaker regulations and incentives at the national level. The average driving range of new BEVs has been steadily increasing. In 2020, the weighted average range for a new battery electric car was about 350 kilometres (km), up from 200 km in 2015.The weighted average range of electric cars in the United States tends to be higher than in China because of a bigger share of small urban electric cars in China.The average electric range of PHEVs has remained relatively constant about 50 km over the past few years. The widest variety of models and the biggest expansion in 2020 was in the SUV segment. More than 55% of announced models worldwide are SUVs and pick-ups. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) may be moving to electrify this segment for the following reasons: Global electric light-commercial vehicle (LCV) stock numbers about 435 000 units. About a third of these are in Europe where new electric LCV registrations in 2020 were only 5% below those in China, which is the world leader. Electric LCV registrations in China in 2020 were 3 400 units below the previous year and slightly less than half of the peak in 2018. The bulk of the electric LCV registrations are BEVs, with PHEVs accounting for less than 10%. In Europe, electric LCV registrations jumped almost 40% in 2020 from the prior year to exceed 37 000 units. Though that was less impressive than the more than doubling of electric car registrations. New EV registrations in Europe are being driven by economic stimulus packages and by CO2 standards that limit emissions per kilometre driven. However, current standards for LCVs are not stringent enough to warrant large-scale electrification, as they do for passenger cars. Registration of electric LCVs in 2020 in the rest of the world were about 19 000 units. Most of these were in Korea, reflecting the launch of two new BEV LCV models, but Canada also added to the stock of electric LCVs. Other markets around the world have yet to see much uptake of electric LCVs. The explosion of home deliveries during the Covid-19 pandemic further boosted the electric LCV expansion in some countries. Increased deliveries raised concerns about air pollution, particularly in urban areas. In response, a number of companies announced plans to electrify delivery fleets.

This table is based on the authors’ understanding of OEM announcements and may not be complete. It includes only announcements related to electric 
light-duty vehicles (PHEVs and BEVs) and it excludes announcements related to hybrid vehicles and those that do not provide a clear indication of the EV share. OEMs are expected to embrace electric mobility more widely in the 2020s. Notably 18 of the 20 largest OEMs (in terms of vehicles sold in 2020), which combined accounted for almost 90% of all worldwide new car registrations in 2020, have announced intentions to increase the number of available models and boost production of electric light-duty vehicles (LDVs). A number of manufacturers have raised the bar to go beyond previous announcements related to EVs with an outlook beyond 2025. More than ten of the largest OEMs worldwide have declared electrification targets for 2030 and beyond. Significantly, some OEMs plan to reconfigure their product lines to produce only electric vehicles. In the first-trimester of 2021 these announcements included: Volvo will only sell electric cars from 2030; Ford will only electric car sales in Europe from 2030; General Motors plans to offer only electric LDVs by 2035; Volkswagen aims for 70% electric car sales in Europe, and 50% in China and the United States by 2030; and Stellantis aims for 70% electric cars sales in Europe and 35% in the United States. Overall, the announcements by the OEMs translate to estimated cumulative sales of electric LDVs of 55-72 million by 2025. In the short term (2021-2022), the estimated cumulative sales align closely with the electric LDV projections in the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario. By 2025, the estimated cumulative sales based on the OEMs announcements are aligned with the trajectories of IEA Sustainable Development Scenario. Electric bus and electric heavy-duty truck (HDT) registrations increased in 2020 in China, Europe and North America. The global electric bus stock was 600 000 in 2020 and the electric HDT stock was 31 000. Bus registrations China continues to dominate the electric bus market, with registration of 78 000 new vehicles in 2020, up 9% on the year to reach a sales share of 27%. Local policies to curb air pollution are the driving force. Electric bus registrations in Europe were 2 100, an increase of around 7%, well below the doubling in registrations seen in 2019. Electric buses now make up 4% of all new bus registrations in Europe. It is too early to see the effect of the non-binding European Clean Bus Deployment Initiative and demand may be still largely driven by muncipal level policies. In North America, there were 580 new electric bus registrations in 2020, down almost 15% from the prior year. In the United States, electric bus deployment primarly reflects polices in California, which is the location of most of the current e-bus stock. In South America, Chile leads the way registering 400 electric buses in 2020 for a total stock of more than 800. India increased electric bus registrations 34% to 600 in 2020. Heavy-duty truck registrations Global electric HDT registrations were 7 400 in 2020, up 10% on the previous year. The global stock of electric HDTs numbers 31 000. China continues to dominate the category, with 6 700 new registrations in 2020, up 10% though much lower than the fourfold increase in 2019. Electric HDT registrations in Europe rose 23% to about 450 vehicles and in the United States increased to 240 vehicles. Electric trucks are still below 1% of sales in both. The availability of electric heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) models is expanding in leading global markets.1 Buses were the earliest and most successful case of electrification in the HDV market, but the growing demand for electric trucks is pushing manufacturers to broaden product lines. Nevertheless, model availability is not the only indicator of a healthy market – fewer total models may reflect the reliability and broad applicability of existing designs, whereas more diversity of models may reflect the need to tailor products for specific needs and operations. The growth in electric model availability from 2020 to 2023 across segments – bus, medium freight truck (MFT), heavy freight truck (HFT) and others – demonstrates manufacturers’ commitments to electrification. Truck makers such as Daimler, MAN, Renault, Scania and Volvo have indicated they see an all-electric future. The broadening range of available zero-emission HDVs, particularly in the HFT segment, demonstrates the commitment to provide fleets the flexibility to meet operational needs. The HDV segment includes a wide variety of vehicle types, e.g. from long-haul freight to garbage collection trucks. China has the most variety in available electric bus models. The availablity of MFT models is broadest in the United States. For HFTs – the segment where the EV model offer is expected to the grow the most – Europe offers the widest selection of models. IEA analysis based on the Global Drive to Zero ZETI tool. Data are derived from CALSTART’s Zero-Emission Technology Inventory. Although the inventory is continuously updated, this snapshot may be not fully comprehensive due to new model announcements and small manufacturers not yet captured in the inventory. The term zero-emission vehicle includes BEVs, PHEVs and FCEVs. Other includes garbage, bucket, concrete mixer, mobile commercial and street sweeper trucks. Years after 2021 include announced models.

Despite a turbulent year, major companies around the world are accelerating the transition to electric mobility by shifting fleets to electric vehicles and installing charging stations. The Climate Group’s EV100 Initiative brings together over 100 companies in 80 markets committed to making electric transport the new normal by 2030. This equates to 4.8 million vehicles switched to EVs and chargers installed in 6 500 locations by 2030. Collectively, by 2020 EV100 members had already deployed 169 000 zero-emission vehicles, double the previous year. Even though companies identify commercial vans and heavy-duty vehicles as the most difficult EVs to find, the number of commercial electric vehicles rose 23% in 2020, including a threefold increase in electric trucks. EV100 members are also expanding the availability of charging infrastructure for staff and customers, with 16 900 charging points installed at 2 100 locations worldwide. Over half of EV100 members are using renewables to power all their charging operations. Significant barriers to EV adoption remain. EV100 members reported the lack of charging infrastructure as the top barrier (especially in the United States and United Kingdom). Lack of availability of appropriate vehicle types was also highlighted by the companies as a persistant obstacle. The purchase price of EVs remains an important hurdle despite many companies acknowledge the significant cost savings over the lifetime of a vehicle due to lower fuel and maintenance costs. To help overcome these barriers, 71% of EV100 members support more favourable EV procurement tax benefits and 70% favour more supportive policies at state, regional and city government levels. Sixty percent of the member companies support government targets to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles. Automotive lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery production was 160 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2020, up 33% from 2019. The increase reflects a 41% increase in electric car registrations and a constant average battery capacity of 55 kilowatt-hours (kWh) for BEVs and 14 kWh for PHEVs. Battery demand for other transport modes increased 10%. Battery production continues to be dominated by China, which accounts for over 70% of global battery cell production capacity. China accounted for the largest share of battery demand at almost 80 GWh in 2020, while Europe had the largest percentage increase at 110% to reach 52 GWh. Demand in the United States was stable at 19 GWh. Nickel-manganese-cobalt continues to be the dominant chemistry for Li-ion batteries, with around 71% sales share and nickel-cobalt-aluminium accounting for most of the rest. Lithium-iron-phosphate battery chemistry has regained sales share but is still under 4% for the electric car market. According to the BNEF’s yearly survey of battery prices, the weighted average cost of automotive batteries declined 13% in 2020 from 2019, reaching USD 137/kWh at a pack level. Lower prices are offered for high volume purchases, confirmed by teardown analysis of a VW ID3 showing an estimated cost of USD 100/kWh for its battery cells. In Europe, demand for batteries in 2020 exceeded domestic production capacity. Today Europe’s main battery factories are located in Poland and Hungary. Production capacity is roughly 35 GWh per year, but announced capacity could yield up to 400 GWh by 2025. Momentum was evident in 2020 in Europe with many new battery plants announced or under construction with support from the European Investment Bank. In the United States, both Korean and domestic battery manufacturers have signalled large investments in a market currently dominated by a Tesla-Panasonic joint venture. Electric micromobility surged in the second-half of 2020, one of the consumer trends that accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic, further boosted by the construction of bike lanes and other measures to promote mobility. Sales of private e-bikes in the United States more than doubled in 2020, outpacing sales of all bikes which were up an already healthy 65%. Many shared micromobility operators reduced or suspended services during the height of the second-quarter 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns. But as confinements were eased, services rebounded strongly, with 270 cities worldwide relaunching operations. As of February 2021, around 650 cities have shared micromobility services. In Europe, e-scooter services have increased rapidly, with more than 100 cities adding operations since July 2020. Preliminary data from operators indicate average trip distances on e-scooters have increased by around 25% relative to before the pandemic. Operators are increasingly offering more powerful e-bikes with plans to expand into electric mopeds, which could further displace longer trips currently completed by car or public transit. Several major operators are introducing swappable batteries to improve operational efficiency and reduce emissions. Although the use of swappable batteries increases the number of total batteries needed to support a fleet, it can significantly reduce operational emissions and enable longer lifetime of vehicles. Privately owned electric two/three-wheelers (which include motorised vehicles such as motorcycles and mopeds but exclude micromobility solutions) are concentrated in Asia, with China accounting for 99% of registrations. The global stock of electric two/three-wheelers is now around 290 million. Electric two/three-wheelers account for one-third of all two/three-wheeler sales. While current sales are dominated by Asia, the market is growing rapidly in Europe, rising by 30% in 2020, benefitting from wider model availability and continued incentives. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are zero-emission vehicles that convert hydrogen stored on-board using a fuel cell to power an electric motor. FCEV cars became commercially available in 2014, though registrations remain three orders of magnitude lower than EVs as hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) are not widely available and unlike EVs cannot be charged at home. Few commercial FCEV models are available and with high fuel cost and purchase prices result in a higher total cost of ownership than EVs. To address the chicken-and-egg problem for FCEVs a number of goverments have funded the construction of HRS and have deployed public buses and trucks, such as garbage trucks, to provide a certain level of station utilisation. Today, there are approximately 540 HRS globally that provide fuel for almost 35 000 FCEVs. Approximately three-quarters of the FCEVs are LDVs, 15% are buses and 10% are trucks. In 2020, Korea took the lead in FCEVs, surpassing the United States and China, to reach more than 10 000 vehicles. To support these FCEVs, the number of HRS in Korea increased by 50%, with 18 new stations in 2020. FCEVs in China are almost exclusively buses and trucks, unlike most other countries where cars are dominant. China accounts for 94% of global fuel cell buses and 99% of fuel cell trucks. In 2020, the global FCEV stock increased 40%, with Korea contributing half and doubling its total FCEV stock. Japan and China increased the number of HRS, each opening about 25 stations in 2020. Worldwide the number of HRS increased 15%. While most charging of EVs is done at home and work, roll-out of publicly accessible charging will be critical as countries leading in EV deployment enter a stage where simpler and improved autonomy will be demanded by EV owners. Publicly accessible chargers reached 1.3 million units in 2020, of which 30% are fast chargers. Installation of publicly accessible chargers was up 45%, a slower pace than the 85% in 2019, likely because work was interrupted in key markets due to the pandemic. China leads the world in availability of both slow and fast publicly accessible chargers. Slow chargers The pace of slow charger (charging power below 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 65% to about 500 000 publicly accessible slow chargers. This represents more than half of the world’s stock of slow chargers. Europe is second with around 250 000 slow chargers, with installtions increasing one-third in 2020. The Netherlands leads in Europe with more than 63 000 slow chargers. Sweden, Finland and Iceland doubled their stock of slow chargers in 2020. Installation of slow chargers in the United States increased 28% in 2020 from the prior year to total 82 000. The number of slow chargers installed in Korea rose 45% in 2020 to 54 000, putting it in second place. Fast chargers The pace of fast charger (charging power more than 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 44% to almost 310 000 fast chargers, slower than the 93% pace of annual growth in 2019. The relatively high number of publically available fast chargers in China is to compensate for a paucity of private charging options and to facilitate achievement of goals for rapid EV deployment. In Europe, fast chargers are being rolled out at a higher rate than slow ones. There are now more than 38 000 public fast chargers, up 55% in 2020, including nearly 7 500 in Germany, 6 200 in the United Kingdom, 4 000 in France and 2 000 in the Netherlands. The United States counts 17 000 fast chargers, of which nearly 60% are Tesla superchargers. Korea has 9 800 fast chargers. Publicly accessible fast chargers facilitate longer journeys. As they are increasingly deployed, they will enable longer trips and encourage late adopters without access to private charging to purchase an electric vehicle. European countries for the most part failed to meet the recommended electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) per EV 2020 targets for publicly accessible chargers set by the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Directive (AFID). However, there are wide disparities between countries. AFID, the key policy regulating the deployment of public electric EVSE in the European Union, recommended that member states aim for 1 public charger per 10 EVs, a ratio of 0.1 in 2020. In the European Union, the average public EVSE per EV ratio was 0.09 at the end of 2020. But that is not the whole story. The Netherlands and Italy are above the target at 0.22 and 0.13 respectively, with almost all being slow chargers, though fast chargers are 3% of the installations in the Netherlands and 9% in Italy. Countries with the highest EV penetration tend to have the lowest EVSE per EV ratios, such as Norway (0.03), Iceland (0.03) and Denmark (0.05). In these sparsely populated countries with many detached houses and private parking spaces, most EV owners can largely use private home charging. To a lesser extent, it also refects that the Nordic countries have a higher proportion of fast chargers, with shares of 40% in Iceland, 31% in Norway and 17% in Denmark. The roll-out of public charging infrastructure has so far mostly focused on serving electric light-duty vehicles. The electrification of heavy freight trucks (HFTs) is a longer term endeavour, with less than 40 electric HFTs on the road in 2020. HFTs require batteries with high capacity to meet their needs for heavy-duty cycles and long-range operations, and consequently they require high power charging. So far charging options for HFTs have tended to be early stage demonstrations, proof-of-concept activities and efforts to faciliate standardisation. Megachargers of 1 megawatt (MW) or more would be capable of charging trucks operating over long distances reasonably quickly. Long-term planning for megacharger infastructure is needed now to avoid negative impacts on the electrical grid. Some impact to grids is inevitable given the high power requirements of megachargers. Significant investment may be needed for grid reinforcements, modernisation, storage and integration with power systems. Planning and co-ordination among electricity generators, distribution system operators and megacharging operations are needed. Some efforts are underway to develop standards for megachargers. Working jointly, the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council have developed an ultra-high power charging standard (up to 900 kW), called ChaoJi. A version up to 1.8 MW, called Ultra ChaoJi, is under development. In parallel, the CharIN initiative established a task force called the Megawatt Charging System Taskforce which aims to develop a new high power standard above 1 MW by 2023 for charging heavy-duty trucks, based on the combined charging system (CCS) standard. Prototype testing started in September 2020. Tesla announced in late 2020 that it is working with third-parties to develop a standard for megachargers that can be provided to Semi truck owners. Tesla is one of five to have submitted a design to CharIN. Industry experts addressing international standardisation are evaluating avenues to harmonise megacharger standards for mutual compatibility, in order to facilitate the roll-out of electric HFTs. There are also regional efforts to develop megacharging infrastructure. Underpinned with stimulus funding, Iberdrola, a Spanish multinational electric utility, has expressed interest in installing megacharger infrastructure in heavy-duty freight truck corridors in Spain by 2025. ElaadNL (EV knowledge centre of Dutch grid operators), along with local and national government entities, in September 2021 launched an open-access test centre for companies and academia that offers test facilities for megachargers. In the United States, the West Coast Clean Transit Corridor Initiative aims to install charging sites capable of charging HDTs at 2 MW along key transit corridors from Mexico to the boder with Canada by 2030.

32,https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/09/24/growth-sector-electric-vehicles-sales-and-the-new-electric-economy/,Growth Sector: Electric Vehicles Sales And The New Electric Economy Have Arrived,"| 3D rendering of a modern electric car.   As the cost of gasoline soared this summer, it only helped to underscore the potential of electric vehicles, still the primary consumer bulkhead for the new electric economy in the U.S. Although gasoline prices are trending back downward, more consumers, businesses and municipalities are looking to electric power as the future of transportation. To understand why Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity, let’s take a deeper dive into the sector. As a consumer, it’s easy to believe that electric vehicles are a relatively new thing. After all, they’ve only started gaining popularity in the last decade or so. You might be shocked to learn that the first electric car in the U.S. hit the open road in 1890. Although William Morrison’s electric vehicle only hit a top speed of 14 miles per hour, this electrified ride jumpstarted America’s interest in EVs. For a while, electric cars and gas-powered cars competed for market share in a big way. But when Henry Ford released the Model T in 1908, the tide turned in favor of gasoline-powered cars, and with that scale came even greater affordability. Our modern interest in electric vehicles stems from the 1997 release of the Toyota Prius. As the first mass-produced hybrid electric vehicle, the car market started to get excited about modern electric vehicles. As automakers create more cost-effective options for getting from point A to point B in EVs, more consumers are making the switch. As of the second quarter of 2022, EV sales accounted for 5.6% of the total auto market. That’s up from 2.7% in the second quarter of 2021. Since the Prius hit the market, EVs have significantly improved to compete with the gasoline-powered vehicles that are the current industry standard. Over time, EVs have become more cost-efficient to operate. Plus, improving technology has helped EVs drive longer ranges on a single charge. However, there are still some clear pros and cons when it comes to electric vehicles. Here’s a closer look at both sides of the coin. Let’s start with the advantages. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, electric vehicles are more energy efficient because they convert over 77% of electrical energy into power at the wheel. That’s a big contrast to gasoline-powered vehicles, which convert 12% to 30% of the energy stored in gasoline to kinetic power. A significant draw of electric vehicles is the ability to limit your environmental impact while driving. If the electricity consumed by your vehicle is produced by a nuclear, hydro, solar or wind source, then your ride emits no pollutants. But if you are charging up from fossil fuel-powered electricity sources, there are still pollutants caused by your drive. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, electric motors create a smoother ride with stronger acceleration - simply put, we buy for horsepower but we drive for torque. EVs are all torque and they are quick off the line. Additionally, EV owners enjoy more limited maintenance requirements than owners of gas-powered vehicles. Of course, there are also some challenges that current EV owners deal with: When compared to gas-powered vehicles, EVs tend to have a more limited range. For example, most EVs can travel at least 100 miles on a single charge. While some can travel over 200 or 300 miles per charge, it’s usually a bit more limited than a gas-powered option. The limited range of EVs can significantly impact consumers’ vehicle choices. Many customers cite a limited driving range as a reason for passing on EV purchases. According to the 2022 Global Automotive Consumer Study conducted by Deloitte, 20% of U.S consumers aren’t considering an EV due to concerns about the driving range. Since U.S. consumers reported an expectation for EVs to have a driving range of at least 500 miles, this limitation may be an issue for years to come. Although charging infrastructure is growing, it’s not fully scaled still. Many would-be EV buyers will hold off on this purchase until they are comfortable with the availability of public charging stations. According to the 2022 Global Automotive Consumer Study conducted by Deloitte, 14% of U.S consumers aren’t considering an EV due to concerns about the lack of available charging infrastructure. Even if the charging infrastructure was sufficient for the growing demand, it takes significantly longer to recharge your EV than it would to fill up your gas tank. Depending on the vehicle, it could take between 3 to 12 hours to fully recharge the battery. Even the quicker option to an 80% charge often takes at least 30 minutes. With that, EV drivers need to factor this extra time into their drive time calculations. As the technology powering electric vehicles improves, there are other factors at play in the industry. Although 13% of U.S. consumers reported that they do not consider purchasing an EV due to the cost, recent changes to the tax code could help to eliminate that burden. When the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was passed in August 2022, it included provisions for tax credits for qualifying EV purchases. Those who purchase an EV that meets the requirements will receive a tax credit of $7,500. The U.S. Department of Energy has compiled a list of EVs that may qualify. The tax credit is part of an incentive plan to meet the Biden administration’s ambitious goal of hitting a 50% EV target of sales shares in the U.S. by 2030. As governments continue to incentivize EVs, it’s possible consumers will start to adopt this newer technology. As electric vehicles gain popularity, other areas of the clean tech industry are also growing. Here’s a look at some clean tech companies to watch:   Of course, there are countless companies in this space. But as consumers and governments prioritize clean energy, the industry will grow in importance. The main draw of an electric vehicle is the potential for a more environmentally-friendly lifestyle. With fewer trips to the gas station, less maintenance and the possibility of emission free driving, it’s easy to see why many are making the switch to electric vehicles. You might not be ready for a new car purchase just yet, but it’s still possible to easily invest in a greener future with the help of Q.ai’s Clean Tech Kit, which makes investing in the electric vehicle economy easy (among other eco-conscious sectors).

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.  First Quarter 2022 Financial Results CANOO INC.

36,https://www.kavout.com/blog/analyst-perspectives-on-canoo-nasdaqgoev-an-investment-evaluation/,Analyst Perspectives on Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV): An Investment Evaluation - Kavout,"Dec 27, 2023 | Stock Analysis Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV), a company within the electric vehicle (EV) industry, has been under the scrutiny of analysts and investors alike. In recent times, the stock has experienced significant volatility, prompting a diverse range of opinions regarding its investment potential. This report aims to dissect the prevailing analyst views on Canoo and assess whether it constitutes a good buy, based on the information provided and within the context of the current market environment.    As of the latest available data, Canoo has been the subject of analysis by HC Wainwright and others, with a consensus price target of $2.02, which suggests a substantial upside of 750.91% from its recent trading price. This optimistic forecast is predicated on the assumption of Canoo’s potential to capitalize on the burgeoning EV market and overcome its current challenges. However, the stock’s performance has not been without its setbacks. A report from The Motley Fool highlights that Canoo’s stock price has plummeted by a staggering 99% (Yahoo Finance). This decline raises concerns about the company’s viability and the sustainability of its business model. Despite this, there are signals that Canoo is ramping up production and preparing to make significant deliveries, which could be a turning point for the company’s financial health and stock performance. The EV market has been characterized by heightened enthusiasm, followed by a sobering correction as the initial hype fades. Canoo, like many of its peers, has not been immune to these fluctuations. The company’s stock has suffered as a result, and market sentiment appears to be cautious. Nonetheless, the EV sector remains a high-growth area, and companies that can navigate the production and delivery challenges effectively may be well-positioned to reap long-term rewards. In comparison to its competitors, Canoo’s current market valuation may reflect a disconnect between its intrinsic value and market price. If Canoo can execute its business plan successfully, it could emerge as a competitive player in the EV space, thus justifying the optimistic price targets set by analysts. Canoo’s third-quarter print was promising, indicating that the company may be on the cusp of a turnaround. A positive financial performance and the potential for future growth have led to a ‘Buy’ rating recommendation by some analysts. This perspective is supported by the company’s strategic moves to increase production capacity and readiness to deliver vehicles in large numbers. It is important to note, however, that investing in Canoo carries significant risk. The company’s stock has already experienced a dramatic decline, and while this could present a buying opportunity for risk-tolerant investors, it also underscores the potential for further losses if Canoo fails to meet its operational and financial targets. Based on the provided information, it appears that analysts are divided on Canoo’s prospects. While there is a consensus on a high upside potential, the stock’s past performance and the overall volatility of the EV market cannot be ignored. As an analyst, I would opine that Canoo may be considered a speculative buy, with a strong emphasis on the speculative nature of this investment. Investors should approach Canoo with caution and be prepared for the possibility of further volatility. The company’s future success will hinge on its ability to scale production, manage costs, and deliver on its promises to customers and investors. Given these considerations, Canoo could be a good buy for those with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon, but it may not be suitable for those seeking stability and predictable returns.

37,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danirvine/2024/02/18/electric-vehicle-sector-faces-market-headwinds-amid-surge-in-adoption/,Electric Vehicle Sector Faces Market Headwinds Amid Surge In Adoption,"A Tesla electric car recharges at a Tesla dealership on January 16, 2024 in Burbank, California. ... [+] (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) In recent years, the electric vehicle market has experienced a remarkable surge in adoption, marking a significant shift in consumer preferences towards greener and more sustainable modes of transportation. This trend is particularly evident in the United States. Urban Science reports that EVs garnered a 7.8% market share across the U.S. in 2023, with some markets, like San Francisco, witnessing explosive growth to 34%. In fact, in certain areas, the market share of EVs grew over 50% between 2022 and 2023, showcasing the sector's rapid expansion. However, this surge in adoption contrasts starkly with the plummeting stock prices of EV manufacturing companies over the past year, raising questions about the sector's financial health and future growth prospects. Selected EV Manufacturer Stock Performance Despite the impressive growth in adoption rates, the EV industry faces significant headwinds that could impact its future trajectory. One of the primary challenges is the affordability of EVs. The rolling back of government subsidies, which previously offered tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchasers, has made electric vehicles more expensive on average than their internal combustion counterparts by 5.5%, according to EV marketplace Find My Electric. In 2024, the number of models qualifying for the full tax credit will be down to just seven, reports TheStreet. Without these incentives, EV sales may slow from the breakneck pace of the last few years. Technological challenges also pose a barrier to broader adoption. During a brutally cold stretch in northern parts of the U.S. in 2023, EVs were left abandoned at charging stations, unable to take on a charge. While advancements may eventually solve issues related to battery performance in extreme climates, these problems currently hinder adoption in certain regions. Despite the downturn in stock prices, the valuations of EV companies remain relatively high. Broad comparisons make most EV stocks appear expensive despite being down 37% to 99.9% off their 52-week highs. Tesla
TSLA
, Rivian, and Lucid, three of the top U.S. EV companies, have seen massive declines in their stock values but still boast a combined market cap of $623 billion, overshadowing the $472 billion combined market cap of traditional automakers Toyota, Stellantis, Ford, and GM. Tesla's market cap alone stands at $600 billion, higher than the four major automakers combined. These valuations raise concerns about whether EV stocks may have further to fall, given their current valuation compared to traditional automakers. The EV market's challenges, including affordability issues and technological hurdles, could slow down the sector's recent sales growth. The reduction in government subsidies may make EVs less attractive to cost-conscious consumers, while technological issues may deter adoption in certain climates. Additionally, despite their recent stock price declines, the high valuations of EV companies suggest that the market may be overly optimistic about the sector's growth prospects. For investors considering entering the EV sector, the current market conditions present opportunities and risks. The surge in EV adoption indicates a strong consumer demand for electric vehicles, driven by environmental concerns and the desire for more efficient transportation. However, the industry's significant challenges, including affordability and technological obstacles, suggest that EV sales growth could slow in the coming years. “The industry has seen a surge of new entrants as well as legacy automakers competing for a share of the EV market,” wrote Gabe Robleto, senior vice president of car dealership mergers and acquisitions firm Kerrigan Advisors, in an email. “While EV sales continue to increase, the rate of growth is slowing and EVs are stacking up on dealers’ lots, with inventory days-supply nearly double that of [internal combustion engine] vehicles.” Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before investing in EV stocks. The high valuations of many EV companies, despite their declining stock prices, suggest that these stocks may still be overvalued relative to their traditional counterparts. Investors should carefully consider the financial health and growth prospects of individual EV companies and look for those with solid fundamentals and a clear path to profitability. Given the uncertain sales outlook for the EV sector a long-term investment strategy is most prudent. The volatility of EV manufactures stock prices makes short-term trading very risky as these immature companies try to find footing in a highly competitive segment of the auto market. The industry is likely to undergo significant changes in the coming years, with some companies potentially failing to survive in their current form. However, the companies who can navigate the economic and technological challenges may emerge as leaders in the new automotive landscape. By carefully selecting individual stocks and adopting a long-term perspective, investors can position themselves to benefit from the continued growth of the EV market while minimizing their risk. With that said, the electric vehicle market is at a critical juncture, with surging adoption rates facing off against economic headwinds and technological challenges. Investors interested in the EV sector must navigate these complexities carefully, focusing on individual name selection and long-term growth prospects. As the industry continues to evolve, those who approach the EV market cautiously and diligently may find long-term value opportunities amidst the challenges. "

The sales of battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric cars tipped over the two-million-vehicle mark for the first time in 2019. In this Deloitte report, we take a new approach to market segmentation and exemplify how to seize opportunities and manage risks. Before the COVID-19 pandemic shook up the automotive industry – along with every other industry – electric vehicles were moving steadily into the spotlight. The combined annual sales of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles tipped over the two-million-vehicle mark for the first time in 2019. This much-anticipated milestone may have become overshadowed by economic uncertainty and changed consumer priorities, but there is value in taking stock of the electric vehicle market even now. Explore the Future of Mobility collection Learn about Deloitte's services Go straight to smart. Get the Deloitte Insights app Since Deloitte last presented a forecast for electric vehicle (EV) sales, in January 2019, the EV market has made great strides, and not just in terms of sales. OEMs have invested billions to deliver new electrified models, from R&D to factory redesign. Consumer attitudes have evolved. Government interventions have pushed forward and pulled back. But then COVID-19 completely disrupted global sales and manufacturing. In this context, a revised forecast based on updated data is needed. By examining the current state of the EV market worldwide and noting the many factors fostering growth in various directions (Part 1 of this report), we have formed conclusions about how the market will take shape over the next decade. The significant growth of EVs leading up to 2030 will present major opportunities and challenges for traditional original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), new-entrant OEMs, captive finance companies and dealerships. In particular, traditional OEMs will find insights in this report that can help them re-prioritise their customers and strategies in a volatile competitive landscape. Paramount to seizing opportunities and managing risks is taking a new approach to market segmentation. We detail one such approach in Part 2 and apply it as a use case to one major market, the United Kingdom, to inform and inspire OEMs and other stakeholders globally. By letting today’s insights fuel the journey for the next ten years, we can accelerate beyond the obstacles the pandemic has brought and toward a future where EVs take centre stage. * In this report, we use the term electric vehicles (EVs) to refer to battery electric vehicles (BEVs), as well as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).1 Unless specifically stated, our analysis has considered both forms of drivetrain. The EV market’s collective accomplishments over the past two years offer hope, despite the short-term impact of COVID-19: a pattern of continued growth, which is expected to be sustained throughout the 2020s. As BEV and PHEV sales surpassed two million vehicles in 2019 (see figure 1), EVs staked their claim on a 2.5 per cent share of all new car sales last year. Looking back at BEVs in 2019, they accounted for 74 per cent of global EV sales: an increase of six percentage points since 2018. This rise was partly stimulated by new, stricter European emissions standards that persuaded manufacturers to favour the production and sale of zero-emission vehicles. Another factor is the advanced state of the BEV market in China, compared to the rest of the world. Although BEVs are still the dominant EV technology in the United States and Europe, they command a smaller share of the market than in China.  Since the last time Deloitte reported on EV sales, significant regional disparities in growth have surfaced. For example, sales of EVs grew by 15 per cent in 2019 compared to 2018, driven by the growth of BEVs in Europe (+93 per cent), China (+17 per cent) and ‘other’ regions (+22 per cent). In contrast, the United States market for BEVs fell 2 per cent (see figure 1). Then, in the first half of 2020, COVID-19 slowed down the growth rate of EV sales, or sent it into decline, across various regions. The speed of recovery is expected to vary by region. But generally speaking, the course seems clear for growth over the next decade, despite the potential lasting impact of COVID-19 on total car sales over the next three years. To understand how things might continue, we need to understand what’s been taking place across the various regional markets over the past year. Europe’s EV sector saw significantly more growth than other regions in 2019. The Nordics and the Netherlands continued to lead the way; Norway achieved 56 per cent market share, and two of the top ten best-selling cars in Holland were BEVs.3 The United Kingdom and some other countries reported triple-digit growth for the year. Favourable government policies and a change in consumer attitudes were the catalysts, driven primarily by growing concerns about climate change. Climate change rose to the top of many European governments’ agendas. The United Kingdom committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and proposed a ban on the sale of all polluting vehicles by 2035.4 Germany plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by the end of 2020, by 55 per cent by the end of 2030 and up to 95 per cent by the end of 2050, compared to 1990 levels.5 Despite the growth seen in 2019, mainstream adoption of EVs has been, so far, hindered by the limited number of models available to the European market and consumer perceptions regarding insufficient charging infrastructure in some regions.6 The outbreak of COVID-19 and national lockdown measures impacted total car sales in Europe, as showrooms closed their doors and manufacturers halted production, but EV sales have held up well in comparison to their internal combustion engine (ICE) equivalents. In the first four months of 2020, in the European Union (EU), demand for new passenger cars contracted by 38.5 per cent, but in April 2020 – the first full month with COVID-19 restrictions in place – registrations of new passenger cars in the EU posted a year-on-year decline of 76.3 per cent, with some major markets reporting declines of over 95 per cent year-on-year.7 But EV sales in Western Europe only fell by 31 per cent in April, with some countries actually reporting modest year-on-year growth – albeit against a low base.8 China continues to dominate the EV market, accounting for half of all vehicle sales. Sales in the second half of 2019 turned out lower than previously expected after some subsidies available to Chinese consumers were halved.9 This considerably eroded the consumer demand for EVs, and total yearly sales dropped: PHEV sales fell by 9 per cent and BEV sales fell to a 17 per cent growth rate from 2018 to 2019.10 On a positive note, a slowdown in the sales of ICE vehicles in the region means that the EV market share in China actually increased. China’s slowdown in the second half of 2019 affected global EV sales figures, but neither the slashed subsidies nor the impact of COVID-19 should impact EV sales significantly in the long term. Chinese authorities announced they would refrain from more subsidy cuts in 2020.11 Meanwhile, other incentives (for example, number-plate privileges in Tier 1 cities) remain, investment is being made in China’s charging infrastructure and there is a continued focus on encouraging Chinese manufacturers to produce and market EVs. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures in place, China saw a 45 per cent decline in passenger car sales in Q1 2020.12 EV sales fell at a faster rate than the total market (by 56 per cent), as consumers stayed home and showrooms closed their doors.13 But the rate of recovery has been swift. By March 2020, Chinese factories had recovered to achieve a production rate of 75 per cent, with 86 per cent of employees returning to work. By April 2020, production had basically been restored to pre-pandemic levels. Although sales have remained depressed in certain Chinese provinces, recovery has been accelerated by pent-up demand, favourable policies put in place by Chinese authorities and the ability to purchase cars online; total sales actually reflected year-on-year growth in April. This brings hope for a ‘V-shaped’ recovery in China, with many individual EV manufacturers already benefitting from the release of new models.14 After an encouraging start to 2019, falling fuel prices in the United States (a market that already enjoys comparatively cheap private transportation) led to a disappointing second half of the year for EV sales. The United States EV market is almost singlehandedly being carried by the success of the Tesla Model 3 – alone responsible for almost half of all EV sales.15 As in Europe and China, United States car sales fell sharply in the first three months of 2020 as the pandemic took a toll on demand; job losses increased and large swathes of the population were ordered to stay home. The recovery in EV sales is likely to be slower in the United States than in other major regions, as manufacturers delay the launch of new cars and consumers take advantage of low oil prices. The world outside Europe, China and the United States is lagging behind in terms of EV sales, for various reasons: a lack of government commitment to EVs, insufficient or unsuitable charging infrastructure, unavailability of EVs and cultural differences regarding mobility models. For example, Japan is a major global car market, but new car sales are dominated by domestic OEMs that have not yet developed the same range of EVs as their European and Chinese competitors. Meanwhile, India, like many markets, is dominated by mass- and low-cost mobility models: an area that OEMs haven’t been able to penetrate so far, because of EVs’ comparative higher price. With one eye firmly on progress so far, Deloitte has analysed the most recent indicators to develop an up-to-date prediction of the EV market for the next ten years. We know that BEVs already outperform PHEVs globally, and predict that by 2030, BEVs will likely account for 81 per cent (25.3 million) of all new EVs sold. By contrast, PHEV sales are expected to reach 5.8 million by 2030. A recovery from COVID-19 will see ICE vehicles return to growth, up to 2025 (81.7 million), then experience a decline in market penetration thereafter. Our global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales (see figure 2). Annual car sales are unlikely to reach pre-COVID-19 levels until 2024. However, the pace of recovery is forecasted to be a result of a slowdown in ICE sales; EVs will continue to have a positive trajectory during the COVID-19 recovery period and may well end up capturing a disproportionate share of the market in the short term. Deloitte expects that by 2030 China will hold 49 per cent of the global EV market, Europe will account for 27 per cent, and the United States will hold 14 per cent.  The share of new car sales taken up by EVs will vary considerably across markets (see figure 3). We forecast China to achieve a domestic market share of around 48 per cent by 2030 – almost double that of the United States (27 per cent), and Europe should achieve 42 per cent. But this doesn’t tell the whole story. Growth in Northern and Western Europe is expected to outstrip that in Southern and Eastern Europe as wealthier countries (such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Nordic countries) likely invest more in infrastructure and offer greater cash and tax incentives to accelerate initial growth.  Beyond 2030, we expect the rate of growth in EV sales to slow. Some markets will be unable to support the transition to EVs in the same way that wealthier nations will over the next decade. Consider that, beyond 2030, one of the key factors in sustaining growth will be the implementation of suitable charging infrastructure. This requires multi-billion-dollar capital investments – achievable in some markets through a combination of public and private investment, but unlikely to be achieved uniformly around the world. In countries that cannot invest in charging infrastructure, we expect the market for ICE vehicles to remain for some time. Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. Consumer demand will fuel the growth of EVs but, at the moment, there are several reasons consumers haven’t swapped their ICE vehicles for equivalent EVs. However, as the barriers to adoption are rapidly removed, EVs are increasingly becoming a realistic and viable option. Figure 4 shows how consumer concerns regarding BEVs have changed, and in many instances diminished, since 2018.  From 2018 to 2020, there were some noticeable changes in consumer attitudes toward EVs. Concerns over the cost/price premium have diminished in every country apart from China (+ two percentage points), which has seen cuts in EV subsidies. Driving range has remained the number-one concern in Germany, and became number one in France, but there are now fewer consumers citing it as a concern in those two markets. Elsewhere, the lack of charging infrastructure has become the top priority for consumers, reflecting the possibility that they are starting to see EVs as a realistic option and are considering the practicalities of ownership. Over the next few years, we expect some barriers to be completely removed. EVs’ driving range is already comparable to that of ICE vehicles; price has already reached parity, if you consider subsidies in various markets and total cost of ownership; and the number of models available is increasing. As EV sales continue to grow and consumers see more of them on the roads, or travel in EVs owned by family or friends, we expect personal experiences to trump concerns. The expected proliferation of commercial EVs (such as vans, trucks, lorries) should also play a part in reassurance, as will the rise of mass-transit options (such as electric buses). Measures that governments take in their COVID-19 recovery plans could also affect consumer sentiment. As part of a $146 billion economic recovery plan, Germany has designated $2.8 billion to EV charging infrastructure and announced new legislation that will oblige all fuel stations to have an EV charging point.19 This is significant progress in a country where driving range and lack of charging infrastructure are the two biggest barriers for consumers. China has made similar commitments, announcing an additional $378 million investment in charging infrastructure as part of a COVID-19 recovery plan.20 Government intervention continues to play an important role in driving EV sales, as shown by the successes in Norway, fluctuating sales in the Netherlands and changing fortunes of the Chinese EV market.21 Not only are there economic benefits for states that support a transition to electric, but the positive environmental impact has made the widespread adoption of EVs a necessary step toward achieving climate-change goals, such as those of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Several policies and regulations are helping encourage the growth of EV adoption: Fuel economy and emission targets These differ across markets and are under constant review and consultation by governments. Recent Deloitte analysis shows that with the phasing-in of new European CO2 emission targets, which will be fully implemented in 2021 and bring punitive fines,22 half of car manufacturers are facing related penalty payments. They’ll owe a total of $0.5 billion in 2020 and $3.7 billion in 2021,23 which could cost the industry approximately $39 billion, based on recent emission levels.24 Such government intervention is shaping OEM strategy: to avoid fines and reputational fallout, OEMs are seeking ways to reduce emissions through increased electrification. City access restrictions City governments have led the way on imposing bans, or punitive taxes, on users of older combustion engines, addressing increasing concerns about toxic air pollution.  In 2019 more cities followed the path already taken in Madrid, Mexico City, Rome and Seattle: Amsterdam, Brussels and Barcelona all took action to reduce the number of ICE vehicles on the road. Several United Kingdom cities also brought forward plans for bans and zero-/low-emission zones. Throughout 2020 we expect this trend to continue as cities worldwide grapple with air pollution and confront their relationships with combustion engines – and private cars in general. Financial incentives Many governments have offered compelling financial incentives to make the electric switch, such as providing cash subsidies to consumers buying low-emission vehicles, reducing taxes on EVs and increasing or maintaining taxes on ICE vehicles. But as EVs reach price parity with ICE vehicles, some governments have explored rolling back such incentives; this can have a dramatic and immediate effect on EV sales, as seen by the recent fluctuations in sales in China and the Netherlands. Instead, in light of COVID-19, the need to stimulate total new car purchases has prompted a range of new financial incentives introduced across major markets, some of which clearly favour EVs. For example, in Germany the government has temporarily lowered VAT from 19 per cent to 16 per cent on low-emission vehicles and doubled existing subsidies to almost $7,000 on EVs costing less than $45,000.25 In France, private consumers who buy electric cars (that cost up to $50,000) now receive an almost $8,000 incentive, up from around $7,000; those looking to get rid of their old cars now receive double the previous value offered by a scrappage scheme, which was designed to get less-efficient models off the road.26 Under both schemes, a consumer replacing an older car for a new EV could be eligible for up to $13,500. Meanwhile, in China, EV subsidies and tax break policies set to expire in 2020 were extended to 2022 in a direct response to the economic impact of COVID-19.27 In the long term, the viability of financial incentives will need to be reconsidered as the economic recovery from the pandemic becomes clearer and governments try to manage other concerns, such as potential lost fuel-tax revenues. In the past year, some prominent OEMs have announced strategic commitments to EVs (see figure 5). New models have been announced, production targets increased and sales targets moved forward and multiplied.  In the short term, COVID-19 may hinder some OEMs in their reach for these targets, as they conserve cash and divert investments elsewhere in the business. But in the long term, we expect these targets to continue as priorities for OEMs. The impact of the investment and targets shown in figure 5 will represent a seismic market shift over the next decade, in terms of availability and affordability of models. Availability of models Recent company announcements have made it clear that there will be substantially more EV models commercially available over the next decade than previously thought. According to statistics cited by the European Federation for Transport and Environment, Europe should expect 33 new models in 2020, 22 in 2021, 30 in 2022 and 33 in 2023.29 This means that BEV models available in the EU will surpass 100 in 2022 and reach 172 in 2025. In the United States, IHS Markit predicts there will be 130 available models by 2026, offered by 43 brands.30 Affordability of models Achieving price parity with, or even savings over, ICE vehicles will play a big role in speeding up EV adoption, especially as model ranges and marketing priorities adapt to manufacturer emission targets. A key takeaway from monthly sales figures in 2019 is just how sensitive consumers are to the relative total cost of ownership when it comes to EVs versus ICE vehicles. This includes upfront costs (as seen in the Chinese EV sales drop when subsidies were cut) and short-term costs, like fuel (as seen in the United States, where EV sales dipped right along with fuel prices). Based on recent company announcements, over the next decade we expect to see EVs – particularly BEVs – become available at the low-cost end of the market, but the roll-out of EVs across all parts of the market is likely to be uneven. Even with more OEMs offering affordable EV models, consumers are still unwilling to pay a premium for an EV instead of its ICE equivalent. However, we expect the existing price premium associated with EVs to be consigned to history sooner rather than later. In some cases, the total cost of owning a BEV or PHEV for private buyers is already less than for the ICE equivalent, and the annual cost of ownership is also balancing out. Meanwhile, for businesses and customers that use company car schemes, favourable tax schemes have already created an environment where EVs can offer savings. We are seeing an increasingly important role for corporates to support the transition to EVs, using the three factors highlighted above to their advantage. Sales of new cars to businesses represents a significant proportion of all cars sold. For instance, Deloitte previously predicted that corporates would account for 63 per cent of total new car sales across Western Europe by 2021.31 In the past year, purpose has continued rising to the top of the corporate agenda, with an increasing number of companies seeking to differentiate themselves by acting as a force for positive change. Because travel is a major avenue for businesses to alleviate emissions, more and more companies are considering how they can support a shift to EVs. Traditional company car schemes are ripe for reinvention: By exploring broader mobility options, businesses are finding value not just in emissions reduction, but in cost savings and improved employee satisfaction. Government tax schemes that target company cars put the emphasis firmly on businesses to lead the way in the shift to EVs. In light of COVID-19, investment in fleets has stalled dramatically as corporates reduce their expenditure and prioritise other investments. Before a comprehensive transition to EVs can take place, business confidence needs to be restored and funds made available again. Corporates also need to consider how fundamental changes to how and where work is done will affect the structure of their mobility schemes. In our previous report, we identified unprecedented levels of competition that threatened incumbent OEMs as the shift to EVs began taking shape.32 That threat has reduced somewhat over the past year as those OEMs doubled down on their investment in the sector, and as the reality of competing in the automotive industry hit home for new market entrants. In China, for instance, 486 registered EV manufacturers have raised over $18 billion in funding since 2011, but their collective manufacturing capacity is unsustainable – considering all reasonable sales forecasts.33 As a result, we expect to see consolidation of the market; some new entrants will fail, and the number of partnerships and joint ventures between Chinese manufacturers and Western OEMs will rise. Outside China, many established OEMs are actually investing in start-ups to take advantage of the capabilities they’ve built.34 Despite the marginal decline in the threat from new entrants and start-ups, there hasn’t been a consistent speed at which incumbent OEMs have reacted to, and planned for, the growth of EVs. The ability of some manufacturers to swiftly accommodate the future of EVs, and trade in their traditional approaches for creative thinking, means that the competitive landscape will likely re-arrange itself accordingly. In an increasingly competitive marketplace, all automotive industry stakeholders – established OEMs, new entrants, captive finance houses and dealerships, for example – should consider how they can convince consumers to purchase an EV – or, specifically, their EV. The obvious choices are to ensure current customers remain loyal during the transition from ICE to EV, or to convert new customers to an EV brand or product. A valuable exercise to achieve either objective (or both) is through a refreshed customer segmentation approach: Targeting consumers by their behaviour and needs. In the sections that follow, we’ve used the United Kingdom as a use case for market segmentation, based on Monitor Deloitte’s GrowthPath® Action Segmentation®.35 Although there are significant differences worldwide when it comes to the structure of the automotive industry, the retail market, the readiness for EV adoption and consumer attitudes and behaviours, the principles of segmentation outlined below can be applied to many major markets. For those where they cannot, the central tenet remains true: Refreshing your consumer segmentation approach can benefit EV sales, stimulating the overall growth of the market. In November 2019 Deloitte conducted a survey of 1,496 United Kingdom residents who are thinking of buying a car in the next three years. More than half of respondents were considering an EV – significantly more than those considering a petrol or diesel car (35 per cent). But their intention doesn’t mean an automatic conversion into purchases. Although sales of EVs in the United Kingdom are rising, BEVs and PHEVs combined still only commanded a 3.1 per cent share of the market in 2019.36 It’s clear that there is an opportunity here to put consumers under the microscope, discerning certain characteristics that will aid in market segmentation and boost EV conversion. Our goal of meaningful and actionable segmentation begins with the United Kingdom survey results: Based on the opinions of these buyers, we can create a segmentation framework based on driving behaviour and a mix of consumer and demographic variables (see figure 6).  In the United Kingdom, the most prominent differences in behaviour and attitudes identified in our survey were determined by how old a consumer is, how much they spend each month and whether they currently own a car or not. Behaviour and attitudes also varied significantly, based on how respondents plan on using their next car and the distances they regularly travel. From the framework, we can see nine potential segments that can categorise future car buyers, all with various meaningful characteristics, behaviours and needs to target and address (see figure 7). To calculate an approximate market size for each segment, a recent industry study offers insight: 56 per cent of adults (17 years and older) believe they will definitely or probably purchase a car in the next three years – a total addressable market of about 30 million people.38  * Using the annual average GBP/USD exchange rate for 2019, <£299/month = <$382/month and +£300/month = +£383/month  This kind of segmentation provides a detailed understanding of modern automotive consumers’ needs, wants and behaviours. Before defining the nuances of each United Kingdom segment by creating Customer Portraits®, let’s consider the obvious differences in key behaviours and attitudes: These characteristics are worthy of careful consideration in the next step of the segmentation exercise: building Customer Portraits. Building a Customer Portrait for each target segment invites insights into key aspects of a consumer that, when viewed collectively, explain their behaviour. It outlines what they do and why they do it, identifying the motives for, and barriers to, behavioural change – or lack thereof. Ultimately, this allows an OEM, captive finance company or dealership to effectively target and encourage desired behaviours by revising marketing and activation strategies. A detailed analysis of survey responses and additional qualitative research informs the individual profiles. Each illustrates a typical consumer in a segment, defines their key characteristics, and then uses the distilled information to present ways that persona can be specifically targeted. As an example, we built three Customer Portraits for segments of United Kingdom–based consumers, complete with suggested actions for OEMs.  Having developed these nuanced Customer Portraits, OEMs and other stakeholders can drill down into the observations to draw conclusions about who is likely to buy what. This will highlight segments to prioritise and where marketing and proposition development budgets can be deployed most effectively. Some segments are naturally more interested in purchasing an EV than others; OEMs and their partners may look to target them first – if the right product mix, capabilities and insight are available to do so effectively. In our United Kingdom example (see figure 8), Segment G is the most likely to consider buying an EV (69 per cent versus the average 50 per cent) – perhaps not surprising, given the relatively higher price tag of EVs up to this point and the greater likelihood of those consumers having off-street parking (77 per cent versus the average 72 per cent). Segment C is also significantly more likely than other segments to consider an EV, but these consumers’ motives seemingly relate to the distance they regularly travel and their awareness of potential ownership savings (e.g., through lower fuel costs and reduced maintenance costs).  Deloitte’s segmentation of the United Kingdom market was performed prior to the emergence of COVID-19. It is important to consider how shifting priorities, in light of the pandemic, may affect the different segments. In the United Kingdom, lockdown measures took consumers out of the automotive retail market for an extended period of time. Even as restrictions are eased, financial concerns may shape how people re-engage with the sector, and to what extent. Lingering health concerns will likely also play a pivotal role in consumer behaviour. Short-term demand for EVs is likely to change, within and across segments. According to consumer research carried out by Deloitte bi-weekly, throughout the pandemic, close to half of United Kingdom consumers now plan to own their current vehicles for longer than originally intended.42 (The number of consumers aged 18 to 34, or 55 and over, who expressed this sentiment is marginally lower than other age groups.) With work travel being a key component of our segmentation, it is also worth considering how COVID-19 is changing how we travel to and for work. The recent research highlights that over two-thirds of consumers plan to limit their use of public transportation in the future, and well over half plan to limit their use of ride-sharing apps. In the short term, this will likely accelerate demand for cheap second-hand cars, but in the long term this could translate into increased demand for EVs within Segment A. COVID-19 might also prove to be a catalyst for the growth of online sales within different segments. Our COVID-19–related research shows that a fifth of consumers now plan to buy their next vehicle online (if possible). This figure is consistently higher among 18- to 34-year-olds, suggesting that Segments B, C, D and E could all demonstrate a significant jump in demand for online services. Ultimately, it’s up to all stakeholders in the automotive industry to consider how they can best serve their prioritised segments. Consumer interest has been sparked, and the onus now lies with new-entry OEMs, captive finance companies, dealerships and, especially, established OEMs to feed the fire. To maximise the opportunities presented by the growing demand for EVs, business leaders in all regions should examine the priorities they have defined according to the segmentation exercise and ask themselves the key questions shown below. The answers may help soften the blow COVID-19 is making on the market and/or aid in the recovery. They’ll also highlight how well-positioned the business is to help accelerate growth in the EV market and reap the benefits when EVs take centre stage.

43,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4428915-canoo-changes-in-business-change-our-view,Canoo: Changes In Business Strategy Change Our View (NASDAQ:GOEV) | Seeking Alpha,"Photo by 3alexd/E+ via Getty Images In a previous article we argued that electric-vehicle maker Canoo's (NASDAQ:GOEV) differentiated technology and go-to-market model would position it favorably in the EV space. The company came public last December following a SPAC merger. On March 29, they released their first financial quarterly report, and it is fair to say that investors weren't happy with the updates that management gave. The company announced a fundamental shift in its go-to-market strategy, away from contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and away from its subscription-model towards focusing on commercial EV opportunities. Shares of Canoo were hit hard after the report, and are down about 65% from the $20 highs we saw back in Jan/Feb, while the company's market cap shrunk to only $1.75bn as of this writing, one of the lowest from a basket of EV upstarts. Data by YCharts When Canoo announced in August 2020 to go public via SPAC with Hennessy Capital Acquisition IV, management laid out an aggressive go-to-market strategy that built on two key pillars: one was the licensing and contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and secondly, the company also planned to sell its different EV-types (including a lifestyle and a multi-purpose delivery vehicle) directly to consumers via a monthly subscription (B2C). For their delivery vehicle the company aims at directly selling them to business in a B2B approach. The focus on these pillars was strongly presented in its SPAC presentation (see some excerpts below): Source: Company presentation The company also put significant focus on the commercial relevance of its contract manufacturing & engineering capabilities, on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology.  Source: Company presentation Both business segments would use the underlying multi-purpose skateboard technology which essentially is a flat, drivable rolling chassis that contains the electrical architecture necessary for EVs. The beauty of the manufacturing approach on the basis of the skateboard is that the vehicle body just needs to be assembled on top of the skateboard, a so-called ""top hat design"" approach, which is expected to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce cost and time to market. According to management the skateboard technology would be the first true steer-by-wire solution that would come to market, which would be an important differentiator from competitor offerings.  It needs to be mentioned here that also other EV manufacturers are working on similar technology concepts, including REE Automotive, which is going public through a SPAC with 10x Capital Venture Acquisition (VCVC), and private-company Rivian Automotive (RIVN). Canoo was planning to contract these manufacturing capabilities to other car manufacturers. Furthermore, management also pivoted towards selling its in-house developed cars via a potentially revolutionary approach, by offering a subscription plan that management claimed would be significantly different from a traditional lease and cost-efficient compared to an ownership model. And the company's plans should not stop here. Management also intended to sell its multi-purpose delivery vehicle in a B2B approach to capture share in the last-mile delivery market, while arguing that the delivery vehicle would offer best-in-class total cost of ownership, cargo volume (30% more parcel volume vs. current options), and functionally-designed features, compared to current delivery-vehicle solutions, possibly enabling up to $50,000 to $80,000 improvement on return on capital over six to seven years, depending on the use case, as compared to other top selling delivery vehicles (Source). The refreshing approach and multiple revenue streams that Canoo's management presented to investors, and the pivot away from the car industry's regular business model definitely drove some of the optimism and hype towards the company. While these were all nice promises, high hopes got crushed when the company announced its first results as a public company. When Canoo announced its first earnings report as a public company on March 29th, the first surprise for many investors was that the company announced key changes to its leadership team. It was announced that Chief financial officer Paul Balciunas would leave the company. Canoo also announced on April 22nd that Tony Aquila will also take on the role of Chief Executive Officer replacing former CEO Ulrich Kranz, who has resigned effective April 30, 2021. While it is not clear as to why former CEO Ulrich Kranz resigned, it gives some bitter taste to the story and we definitely don't like the high leadership turnover. But these were not the only announcements that put pressure on Canoo's stock. The company announced a number of changes, including that it would no longer pursue the contract engineering part of its business. The reason was that the company wants to protect its intellectual property which it seemingly would not be able to do by licensing it to other manufacturers. On the conference call, analyst Craig Irwin asked about the conflicting statements that management gave:  Craig Irwin: Okay. The second question there - there's a little bit of a contradiction in your prepared remarks. So Tony, you talked about how engineering IP broadens your TAM, but then you announced that you're deemphasizing your engineering services. Can you help us resolve that and maybe give us a little bit more color about why you would deemphasize engineering, given that the original story was - it would subsidize the development and broaden the partner opportunity with potentially multiple hats on their license. Tony Aquila: Yes. So look, I would say that from the comments perspective it was a contradiction, it hasn't been a contradiction from my statement. Look, as I said in the new marks we looked into this, it kind of goes to your first question too with the talent war and everything just the $25 million, it would yield us. We at the board really feel like the best thing to do is to accelerate our derivatives and focus our talent on creating IP for the company. You also have a lot of IP leakage when you do this work. And from my perspective, if I had been more involved earlier certainly, I certainly once I started - I invested and then I took the chairmanship, we started the analysis. I had concerns about this. If you study all OEMs, you can find a partnership or something like that if it makes sense. And we'll continue to look for things, but to be a contract engineering house is just really not going to drive the best shareholder value. While the answer from Tony Aquila eluded to potential IP leakage and the concerns management had that this approach would not be driving the best shareholder value, we are not very happy with the contradictory explanation. This is especially concerning in light of the fact that Canoo initially planned to generate revenue from the contract manufacturing segment of >$500 million by 2025, with a CAGR of 39% between 2021 and 2025 (see our calculation here). It's dubious to us why management now suddenly makes a U-turn when the management team should not have provided such bloated numbers leading to its SPAC deal just to give potential investors false promises on what many investors saw as a key differentiator vs. competition. The announced change on the contract engineering front also undermines all hopes from Canoo's earlier announced partnership with Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMTF) while it also puts to rest any hopes for a potential deal with Apple (AAPL). Again, management didn't give a clear answer to questions on their plans during the conference call when asked by analysts:  Joseph Spak: Okay. Well, last one for me, just going back to the decision to deemphasize engineering with the Hyundai arrangement the original one, which I'm assuming that that's now off the table. But if you go back to that release, did say Hyundai gains access to technology, you mentioned IP leakage is one of the potential problems with that arrangement. Can you just talk about, like how do you unwind that sort of memorandum of understanding what work was done? Do you think there was any IP leakage obviously Hyundai is coming out with their own electric vehicle platforms as well? Tony Aquila I think what happened is pretty kind of case in point. So I think the company, just like any adolescent companies, it's learning its way and all of us go through it. But it factored in contract manufacturing based on the labor of engineers, not based on the value of IP, which would have changed the value of that contract significantly. And look, we have experience in this area and we're very focused on if we do work, one, we can protect our IP and we can get the residual value of that in addition to. So it's kind of caused us to say, hey, let's put that on hold. We have so much demand for our three derivatives. Let's get all that work done. And then let's, look at if there is partnerships, partnerships can work in this industry. But contract manufacturing work is as you know is not the best business line to be in. The announced changes in Canoo's strategy don't stop here as management also mentioned that the previously announced subscription model for its direct-to-consumer offerings (lifestyle and sports vehicle) will now only be optional, and are expected to only account for a small part of its revenue going forward, especially since the consumer business will be de-emphasized in favor of commercial opportunities. This is a significant strategy shift as the company initially forecasted subscription revenue to reach almost $2 billion by 2026 (see forecast below). So again, why did management not get to the realization earlier that this would not be the most promising path?  Source: company presentation With all these changes, Canoo is now a fundamentally changed story and a perfect example of why investors should be cautious to believe in pre-SPAC projections. We have made a similar mistake by putting too much trust into management's projections. While we always took a very careful stance at the company's projections, the significant U-turn lead is to sell our shares over the past weeks. Wall Street seems to agree that the fundamental changes in Canoo's business model create many uncertainties to say the least: The recently announced changes imply a fundamental shift in the business and go-to-market strategy. While the core technology of Canoo's multi-purpose platform did not change, it remains a big question mark how the company will use this technology to generate revenue besides in-house manufacturing when they are shying away from building up a contract engineering business. Canoo remains only one very small player amongst many upstarts within the highly competitive EV industry. So deemphasizing potential revenue-generating partnerships will not only create a cash-problem going forward, but will also take off some of the buzz that was generated around the Hyundai, as well as the potential Apple partnership. The recent strategy changes create a high level of uncertainty as to how the company will finally be able to generate revenue. Canoo's business model is currently no more refined or differentiated than it was at its inception. In fact, it appears that management is not sure themselves what the best route to commercialization is. While several of the announced changes could be regarded as logical, i.e. the pivot towards commercial opportunities, the changes introduce further risk around the company's ability to execute. While it's probably worth asking as to how much the initial story really changed it is a fact that two main pillars of the company's initial forecast, i.e. contract engineering and car-subscriptions, which together accounted for a combined total of around $2.5bn in revenue until 2026, will simply be eliminated from the forecast. Since so much has changed and the path to revenue generation is increasingly unclear, we are distancing ourselves from Canoo stock for the foreseeable future. But Canoo's management may still prove their critics wrong with what's left of the company: an intriguing underlying technology and a market cap that is below the initial SPAC valuation and significantly smaller compared to many of its high-flying peers. However, this is simply too much of a gamble for us. So we will be staying on the sidelines on Canoo stock after selling all our shares over the past weeks.
